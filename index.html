      <p>This is really amazing, if your area is on a P25 digital trunk system. I&#8217;ve been enjoying the city of Cincinnati&#8217;s P25 digital as a source of great entertainment.  Having a 2nd tuner dedicated for the control frequency really helps this setup in terms of responsiveness.  Disable UAC and run as admin for all programs involved (SDR#, Unitrunker, DSD) if issues arrise.</p>

I used this method when I built the first version of my car&#8217;s custom wiring harness, and it helps quite a lot, but it&#8217;s still a massive pain to work with when you&#8217;ve got that many wires.  The pic below shows what I mean&#8230;</p>

      <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing quite like a nice, simple hack. This serial servo controller uses a PIC12C671 and a pair of resistors. Leaving out the power supply, that&#8217;s the lowest part count I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>

      <p>please, I beg of you, don&#8217;t abuse the sample process like that.  It is because of you little turds that most companies don&#8217;t sample any more, or charge for samples.  If you need to sample a single part, even 2, ok but if you need more than that man up and buy them.</p>
