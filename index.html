      <p>That&#8217;s cool. On Adam Savage&#8217;s podcast, he was complaining about a lack of bluetooth hearing aids. While some parts of the technology are really advanced, they do seem to lack in the value adding features department. I suppose this will change as more people who have grown up with headphones and mobile technology start to get hearing aids and demand better interfaces.</p>

      <p>There&#8217;s no lower common denominator than HD44780-based character LCDs.  They&#8217;re cheap, easy to find, easy to interface to, and don&#8217;t have the uC memory overhead of storing fonts and icons.  Moving on up, there are the Nokia 6100 LCDs (color, 128&#215;128 graphics, SPI).</p>
