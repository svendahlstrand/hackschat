      <p>For the love of god, &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; = &#8220;it is&#8221;. Every time you write a sentence with &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; in it, read the sentence back in your head, but replace the it&#8217;s with &#8220;it is&#8221;. Does the sentence make sense? No? Then lose the apostrophe. Third grade grammar is not difficult.</p>

      <p>He wired the chips in parallel &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t seem to be a good idea.  Resonators are usually driven by a not gate &#8211; one pin is an input, the other is an output. It&#8217;s wired so that the two outputs are driving each other &#8212; bad practice!  This will waste energy and stress the parts.  It&#8217;ll also create a lot of electrical noise as the power supply is repeatedly asked to supply the short circuit current every oscillation.</p>

      <p>those VCR heads will really cut up the skin on your hand if you keep spinning it around whale you hold it, those machined edges are Sharp. (but I suppose most of the cuts I got from handleing VCR heads didnt hurt, but my hands sure did look narly when they would get dirt in those cuts!) but I suppose its not nearly as sharp and cut inducing as a lot of the other parts on that mouse!</p>
