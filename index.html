      <p>Wat? These things are sought after?! The SB32 had the wave samples onboard antiquating the add-on boards. Also, if memory serves, Yamaha released a driver which did the same for your sb16 in software using the very same wave samples. I remember the card had some number of instruments encoded within it and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;d be much of a leap to do it in software without this (or the original) add on board.</p>

      <p>In an electric guitar, the body material has little to no influence on the sound (comes from strings &amp; pickups). It has an influence on the comfort to carry it, though, as a completely hollow body has to be much bigger to counter the weight of the neck and head, otherwise it will be uncomfortable to play.</p>
