      <p>You don&#8217;t need two chips for stereo. The AY-3-8910 actually has *three* independent channels &#8211; it&#8217;s not &#8220;three simultaneous notes&#8221; mixed internally, each channel has it&#8217;s own output pin. So you can do stereo with just one chip, you just need to mix the output signals appropriately. You use two chips so you can get six channels :)</p>
