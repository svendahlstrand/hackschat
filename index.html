      <p>I had picked up one of these used around Xmas on the tip that some of these were of an older arm based design capable of running other emulators besides the genesis. Sadly the one i scored used atgames proprietary RedKid processor. This may be the answer to my hopes of having a portable retro nintendo system.i am curios however if it would have been possible to reuse the existing battery charging circuitry built into the stock pcb</p>

      <p>Very very nice. Makes me want to make one myself, but I don&#8217;t have the soldering skill or the patience to do it. The only thing I can think of is combine the wall jack and battery charger and just step the voltage up/down depending on the needs for the batteries or use the battery charger and step it up/down for the system requirements.</p>

      <p>The amount of extras that you need really drills home the point that it ain&#8217;t quite there yet. Now if someone put out a box the same size as the mini wth a big hard drive, audio/video in/out and a few xtra ports then that would be good. Sit it next to your mac mini in the stereo rack and connect via firewire. It would look good and get rid of all the extra boxes.</p>
