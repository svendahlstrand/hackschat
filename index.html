      <p>Awesome!  Now add a similar for bugs and critters that uses a laser and can identify humans and pets and not fry them.  I had commented on EEVblog I think&#8230; I forget&#8230; noting to use a distance finder so the tuned laser for the target most optimally discharges on the target.  Awesome as a heater for sure as is!</p>

      <p>I bought the Saleae Logic Pro 16 when it was a kickstarter a few years ago. It can do mixes of 16 inputs of analog and digital, within the bandwidth of a USB 3.0 link. There are bandwidth tradeoffs depending on how many channels are used and for what. I got their old Logic 8-input digital data analyzer a few years before that, and since I liked it so much, I bought into their kickstarter. Too bad I retired since then, so I don&#8217;t come across the need for all that capability that often anymore. Check it out at saleae.com. They even have an SDK to extend and write your own stuff.</p>

      <p>Sounds an awful lot like a punch card to me, and  a really high-tech punch card at that. Pretty neat. Maybe this could have application for music purchases? You pay one-time for a certain number of cards with music on them, and then when you get sick of listening to a song you just swipe it and swap for another song. I realize it&#8217;s only 1 kb right now, but it&#8217;s a thought.</p>
