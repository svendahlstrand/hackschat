      <p>Saying that a sail boat is a better option than a (presumably) solar electric craft, because is doesn&#8217;t have to carry as many batteries, is like saying a solar PV solar is better because it doesn&#8217;t have to carry as many bottles of compressed air. Both are powered by the elements. In the doldrums, solar electric is probably the better choice, in the arctic, wind is probably the better choice.</p>

      <p>A small step forgotten in the article as well as on the original project page: one needs to create the face of the clock by yourself. Completely and not only putting a few LEDs behind an existing face after removing the hands and movement. At least the version from the starting Ikea clock I saw had a completely different looking face.</p>
