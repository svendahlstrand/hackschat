      <p>Well, for me this is scary .. My friends mom is a cardiologist and works with heart implants. Some time ago i heard a story about one of her patient that came for a checkup. I don&#8217;t know the model or more details about his pacemaker, but i&#8217;ve heard that she discovered that someone else was logging in .. and .. no, there were no logs about eventual changes in the devices settings :/ because the producer didn&#8217;t include such functionality .. and this is SCARY.</p>
