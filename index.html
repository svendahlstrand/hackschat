      <p>This is freakin awesome. Definitely what 3d printers ought to be used for. I&#8217;m grabbing those plans for sure. These kinds of projects make machining accessable to many people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t get to experiment, and that&#8217;s fantastic.</p>

      <p>I seem to remember that eyeball shaped webcam that came out in the mid noughts has a grounded pin inside that would give it a &#8220;bulb&#8221; setting, that is &#8220;shutter open till &#8230;&#8221;. Perfect for astro-photography. Crappy res, and probably no better than what is in a Samsung phone camera shooting video.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m in the process of finishing up a very similar build.  Using the laser carriage from a cd/dvd drive as the traverse mechanism (as you put it).  Mine uses an Arduino brain.  Got interested in winding coils after my Make mag inspired CBG build.  Good stuff here.</p>
