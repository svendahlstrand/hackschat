A comparitor or such told of relative cloudiness. Probably Popular Electronics. I was 8, trying to read my ARRL&#8230; not knowing it was for adults&#8230; my parents wisely not deterring me.

      <p>umm&#8230; guys, this is cool and all, but is it really a hack to piece together a system? The hard drive window thing, yeah thats a hack&#8230; or a mod, but they&#8217;re close enough. I&#8217;m just tired of seeing so many things labeled a &#8216;hack&#8217; when they really  arent&#8217;&#8230;</p>
