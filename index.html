      <p>I just designed my first PCB this year, and am not ashamed to admit I started with Fritzing, since I was already comfortable using it for other purposes. (I&#8217;ve since started using Eagle, which has its own plethora of issues) WRTO custom PCB shapes using Fritzing/Inkscape, you CAN edit the Layer ID from within Inkscape via the XML Editor option (on the Edit menu). I was able to successfully make custom shaped boards this way without manually editing the SVG file.</p>

      <p>&#8220;[Dave] was inspired by the HOTAS throttle control system, which is commonly used in aviation. The basic idea behind HOTAS is that the pilot has a bunch of controls built right into the throttle stick. This way, the pilot doesn‚Äôt ever have to remove his hand from the throttle. [Dave] took this basic concept and ran with it.&#8221; -&gt; a normal mouse?</p>

      <p>a couple af days ago you were railing against the dangers of DIY scuba gear, and then you publicise this!  yes, the project says not to repeat it, but hell, if your dumb enough to put 120v across a pair of exposed forks, your probably not going to listen.  also not that this is probably a 120v outlet.  try doing this from a country with 240v.  double the voltage, double the current, four times the power!</p>
