      <p>A worthy project. A good idea would be for many as possible, to keep copies of the files in their possession, just in case something ends the project without warning. I found a scan of a Sinclair duplexer for a LMR repeater. Who made the scan failed to dust off the glass. That eyelash got to me , where I &#8220;had&#8221; to fix it. Just glad the document was&#8217;t a 100+ pages.  Surely there are tools that can be used to clean up scans easily, understanding, the are pretty poor scans out there.</p>

      <p>That USB port may be useful for a backup data store for when the link goes down, no point throwing away good data if you can send it later with time stamps. NTP is covered by the ESP8266&#8217;s capabilities so long as it can get an update every day, or whatever. How stable is the clock on the ESPs?</p>

      <p>Good, but put the stomp switches on a thinner wedge shaped stomp proof box. A hollowed out piece of wood would be safe. It&#8217;s too much to lift your foot that high while standing. You could even make the switches from thin leaf contacts and make a thin stomp surface!</p>

      <p>Maybe a couple of layers of roughly sanded clear acrylic with a 1mm gap between them or even a bit of white paper stuck in between the LEDs and the end of the fiberoptics with a 3 or 5mm gap would be the cheapest way to defuse the colours. Anyway nice build (: if i ever do this for my self I would be tempted to mount the electronics in the ceiling though or at least make the enclosure a little smaller (maybe fit it inside a plaster moulding). It would be tempting to use acrylic rods bent into shape instead of rings cut from a flat sheet (might make using the fibreoptics a little harder but it saves a lot of sanding). Might also add some super bright LEDs (some in the moulding pointing across the ceiling and some on the rings pointing up as not to &#8220;blind&#8221; the current of the room on a separate circuit to add a bit of light to the room and not just colour (shame to have something so nice and still have to have a standard light fitting to aluminate enough to see detail by).</p>

      <p>I had a very interesting conversation with someone at work, a few years ago, about how they used water injection in their muscle car in the &#8217;60s.  I don&#8217;t remember the details as to why it increased the horsepower but he claimed that it made a big difference with his non-turbo engine.  Personally I&#8217;m intrigued by propane injection for diesel engines but if I ever fit a turbo to the wife&#8217;s focus who knows, water injection could be a possibility&#8230;</p>
