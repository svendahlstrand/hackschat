There&#8217;s your product niche!  We get &#8220;Silver Alerts&#8221; broadcast from time to time when another sufferer has reached the stage where they manage to wander up to hundreds of miles away.

      <p>very cool and intresting. It&#8217;s funny too because at my nasa bioengineering mentorship last year i prototyped somthing very similar to this and then adapted it to optimize pilot aircraft interface. We ended up getting a patent on the aircraft portion, but i always thought that the playstation biofeedback alone would be very cool to have. Nice to see that someone else thought so too :)</p>
