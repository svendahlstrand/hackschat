      <p>My introduction to touch screens was at a computer store in the early &#8217;80&#8217;s. They had one hooked up to a brand new Commodore 64 (yes, it really was that many years ago), and my father and I were both just mesmerized by the thing. My dad ended up buying a C-64 shortly after that, but never got a touch-screen for it. I suspect that the price was astronomical, but I don&#8217;t remember what it was. </p>

      <p>I recognize these chips. ;) Used them awhile back to also create a lighted sign, though no scrolling display. The sign consisted of 4 letters total (around 2 x 3 feet in size) populated with 20 &#8211; 30 RGB LED triplets (we could only find bulk LEDs at a reasonable price). Each letter was on a separate chip with an RGB channel for each letter. </p>
