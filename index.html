      <p>I pulled a Bosch blue tool case out from under some broken tiles in a skip whilst on a run one night, to find a $800 Bosch rotary hammer inside, with a mess of duct tape around the cord and gland, holding it in a particular orientation; doesn&#8217;t take a rocket surgeon to work out the score. $5 worth of plug and cord later, so far I&#8217;ve got dozens of holes and about 10 hours of chiseling/jackhammering time put on my free $800 tool without hint of a fault.</p>

      <p>I love the propeller system. The whole concept of &#8216;cogs&#8217; or code chunks, and having 8 seperate processor cores to assign code execution to with cross-timing is a GREAT idea, and it&#8217;s cool that it&#8217;s a completely home-brew-friendly system too. You can get these processors for around $8 from digikey.</p>
