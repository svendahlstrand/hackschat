      <p>I don&#8217;t know if I would call these PSoCs, &#8220;CPLD&#8221; like. They have some programmable logic but it&#8217;s very small even compared to a CPLD and it is also just one of many parts of this chip. Also these PSoCs have programmable analog circuits. CPLDs and FPGAs don&#8217;t have any analog. </p>

      <p>The gears that have some teeth cut down aren&#8217;t a 1:10 reducer but a 1:2 reducer.  From what I remember it&#8217;s because the wheel that causes the 1:10 reduction has two teeth on it but you only want to flip the 10s counter once when it completes its revolution.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m not a huge fan of random noise myself. It seems like it wouldn&#8217;t be that hard to at least organize the sounds into a melody or something. I even enjoy electronic music and chiptunes, so it&#8217;s not like I just dislike the entire sound.</p>
