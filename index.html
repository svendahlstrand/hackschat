      <p>I recall at a convention someone who used the Unscrambler claiming he was doing amazingly well with the sports spread or whatever the gambling event is.  Figured out patterns when loading the historical data set and reviewing for factors or something and patterns were surprisingly obvious.  Same goes with a presenter from the Mathworks noting how a client used a custom toolset for modeling financial application which started returning it&#8217;s investment and profiting in a few months (if I remember correctly due to capital effect and market margins being low in the sector applied).  Then shortly after&#8230; seemed algorithmic trading (robo trading) started to become more main stream marketed.  There are patterns and factors that weigh into predicting patterns specifically, repeatably, etc. validly.  I started working on a self learning application and some don&#8217;t like that especially with signals.</p>

      <p>Nice project, I like weather-resistant coating and self-powering. My experience with DHT22/AM2302 modules are not so shiny, the best way to test this is to make little project on breadboard with 2,3,4 or 5 &#8230; modules next to each other and display values from all of them on small display. Temperatures are pretty OK, but humidity varies more than worst case in datasheet. So it&#8217;s question do you really want to have weather station that says it&#8217;s 80% humidity when it&#8217;s 90%.</p>

      <p>Searching a HDD for passwords and seed words for dictionary-bruteforce hybrid attacks is how a lot of forensics is done on recovering data, and isn&#8217;t a very new tactic. But, I was shocked to find out that flash drive info was as recoverable as it was; I&#8217;ve heard of people using them for swap partitions because it&#8217;s &#8220;safer&#8221;.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve made this.  Really fun.  Took forever to nest the two cans.  What drew me to it was the amazingly appealing flame that comes out of the finished product.  It really works.  Trickiest part is making some sort of simple/light stand that is sturdy enough to hold a pan above the flame.</p>
