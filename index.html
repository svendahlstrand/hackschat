      <p>This would be really great to do to the C64DTV (which I got for Xmas a few years ago). You could do something like a Gameboy Advance SP, clamshell case. You&#8217;d need to customise the SD-card interface to connect to the DTV&#8217;s expansion solder point, and fix a nice PS/2 socket to it for a keyboard. That&#8217;d be something to be proud of!</p>
