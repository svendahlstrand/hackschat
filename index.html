      <p>There&#8217;s actually another way. Divide a 5&#215;8 character field in three parts (upper &#8211; middle &#8211; lower), then fill the custom characters which all the combinations of these parts on/off possible. Character 0 is all off, character 1 is top black, character 2 is middle black, character 3 is top and middle black &#8211; you get the point. Now, with the right control routines you have a 16&#215;12 display instead of a 16&#215;4! (Ok, with a somewhat weird aspect ratio.)</p>
