      <p>So&#8230; this sounds interesting, except for the fact it took me like, 15 minutes to find the documentation and it&#8217;s still not clear what the heck the code is actually running on or where it&#8217;s running. And I&#8217;m still not sure: it *seems* like it&#8217;s actually an environment for programming *their* hardware+FPGAs in Go, without any indication of what their hardware actually is.</p>

      <p>in my experience, AD&#8217;s chips are usually much more expensive from digikey than direct from AD (the ad8397, for example, is also about twice as much). The only problem, though, is that it&#8217;s cheaper only if you can buy 260 of them at once. You might be able to find the chips cheaper from Newark, but from what I&#8217;ve heard, they usually make up for their cheaper prices (and more) from their rather outrageous shipping costs.</p>
