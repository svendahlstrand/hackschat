      <p>Very cool- I&#8217;ve been looking for a small mp3 player (a la the slimp3) but without the damned display. I don&#8217;t use it so why should I pay for it? That said $110 for the kit plus LCD plus TINI modules puts you in the ballpark of a slimp3 player so why not just get one to begin with? Would have been nice to do away with the TINI module and just get ethernet up and running on a small ARM core.</p>
