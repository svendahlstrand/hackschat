      <p>I heard that JB Weld is made with powdered steel if I&#8217;m not mistaken which could account for its color and strength.  It is therefore possible it could be conductive, at least a little bit compared to a regular FR4 board.  Has anyone tested this glue to verify how conductive it is?</p>

      <p>when i used to manufacture optics we did the same sort of thing but upside down. The mirror was attached to the plate the spindle rotated in, and swept across a large, thick, rotating steel plate that the liquid abrasive was dripped onto. No stabilizer arm was needed but to do a good polish the big turntable/plate absolutely had to be thick and flat so it didnt flex. </p>
