      <p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be possible to put a short charging cable inside and attach that to a host port so you can retrieve some sort of ID when the device is plugged in? Would save one from having to guesstimate what&#8217;s in the box by taking measurements&#8230; might be my approach when I need to implement this in a couple years for my kids :-)</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve always thought it would be nifty to make a quick firmware for the ESP8266 that does this on the cheap. You could even sell them for a buck over what you paid and make a tidy sum from people that couldn&#8217;t be bothered to flash them (or lack the kit).</p>
