      <p>I understood how they worked from a textbook definition. But the way this video presents it makes it feel so simple that I could build a fluid coupling in my kitchen out of ordinary materials. Really helps to see something without all the ridiculous jargon that&#8217;s gotten attached to it over the years.</p>

      <p>Cheers, Hackaday! You are my favorite website and you inspired me to learn electronics and make cool stuff. You are fun and entertaining, you know what humor is, you know how to be sarcastic nicely outlining that not everything in this world is meaningful, but hacks preventing robot invasions certainly are. I wish you all the best, I wish your readers all the best and may we all have a nice 2012 full of decent hacks. Be creative people! Thank you!</p>

      <p>isnt it a bad idea to connect the outputs of voltage regulators together? i mean, once a load is put on them, wouldnt the regulators cease to regulate properly? i&#8217;m not saying one way or the other, it seems like this should work just fine, but i&#8217;ve had people tell me it will screw up regulation and you&#8217;ll get weird voltages, can anyone clarify this??</p>
