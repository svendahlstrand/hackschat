      <p>You can also use a MCP23017 instead of a shift register and directly address the outputs. You can add up to 128 I/O, 16 per chip. Only two I/O is needed to communicate to all the expander chips using I2C. Same I/O gets real time clock data from a DS3231 chip. All data is displayed on a web page hosted on the controller. Details and other applications are here: </p>

      <p>Why grab the altitude from a GPS receiver?  The density altitude is based on pressure altitude, not altitude above mean sea level.  It seems that every inexpensive MEMS barometer is temperature compensated, so they include the temperature sensor.  An LPS25HB, from ST Microelectronics, would work perfectly.</p>

      <p>Good Start?  Maybe, but there&#8217;s a whole lot of assumptions going on there, and testing it with ONE POOL ONE TIME is not proof of anything, except that the author is clueless about the scientific method.  Assuming it is effective (and that&#8217;s yet to be proven) why is putting a device, even a $10 device, easier/cheaper/more cost or time effective then just emptying the standing water pools and preventing new water from accumulating?  10 abandoned tires would require $100 worth of gadgets, or about 10 minutes with a awl to punch a few holes in them to prevent water accumulation.</p>

      <p>Yea, these have been around for a while. TI has annual conferences across the country (which are free) called 430 day (their processor is the MSP430 for those who didn&#8217;t already know). At the conferences they basically give you a run down of the families features, feed you and send you off with a free development kit. I got two of the 2nd one pictured at the last 430 day.</p>
