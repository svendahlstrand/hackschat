      <p>I dont have any hacks for this, but as I was studying HVAC in college, we got to mess with one of these as they came out.  We had an issue with the RC and RH terminals not being jumped together and there isnt enough room for 2 wires in 1 slot.  Has this issue been resolved on this model?  The one I messed with was here in the USA.</p>

      <p>My only suggestion would be to lay out the buttons in a more ergonomic fashion.  Other then that this looks like an excellent alternative to hacking a keyboard for a mame cabinet controller and probably a bit cheaper too.</p>
