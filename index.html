      <p>If you don&#8217;t have access to a vacuum pump, another alternative would be to store / dry filament in an enclosure with a nitrogen purge (N2 tank + regulator).  Nitrogen from a gas supplier should have an extremely low dew point (read: very dry).  Nitrogen drying is an established method of drying out equipment, pipelines, food, etc.</p>

      <p>I decapped some ceramic dram, added a crude cover and played with refreshing them not quite enough. From memory this was 1977/8, and again from memory wrote a zero, and light made it bleed off to a one. It didn&#8217;t really work very well.  Crude shapes &#8211; yes, images &#8211; no.</p>

      <p>Cool work but the biggest problem with small walkers is the smaller you make them the more critical angular inaccuracies become, and guess what happens when you need to use smaller and inherently less precise servos? Mini servos often come with all sorts of jitter to deal with also as they try to maintain position. </p>
