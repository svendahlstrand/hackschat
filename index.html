      <p>But how much energy is required to recycle the material? And how many hazardous chemicals does the material leach after recycling? Those are the big problems with recycling many plastics. It takes massive amounts of energy (creating more polution than just burning it in a good incinerator) and/or it leaches toxic materials into whatever touches it.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve participated in several of these kinds of balloon projects, one including the solar eclipse last year. They&#8217;re really a ton of fun. The flight is pretty rough for the electronics sometimes depending on how the flight is done, so it can feel just like watching a SpaceX launch. Biting your nails through the whole flight watching the tracker waiting for the pop, unsure if you really tested every single possible thing that could go wrong. And if the system records good data, its such a cool connection to your local area to understand in a new way what is going on above you. I mean, I could just look it up on wikipedia or something sure, but testing the sensor, becoming familiar with what it takes for it to read something extreme, and then graphing the data after a flight to find that things were even more extreme than I expected.</p>
