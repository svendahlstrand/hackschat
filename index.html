      <p>You know, it&#8217;s funny.  During the course of my EE degree, I&#8217;ve taken a handful of signals classes and only applied transfer functions on paper for signal (AM, FM, PM, etc) transforms and bandwidth calculations.  I think it&#8217;s bad that this if the first time I&#8217;ve seen transfer functions used in a physical example.  Great presentation.</p>
