      <p>Read the thesis, a good write-up! Be aware that currently there is no patient isolation with this circuit. It is the electrode front-end amplifier. Battery power only unless you happen to have a medical grade isolated supply or converter. That includes the Arduino. I recall a post about an isolated FTDI usb to RS232 recently</p>
