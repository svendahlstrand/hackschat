      <p>That is a very good video! The only criticism is it doesn&#8217;t say much about the wire itself and what frequency and current it runs at. Maybe somebody here knows more about it? ????</p>

      <p>Man I read this site every day and I wish I knew how to do any of this stuff. I have very basic electronics knowledge (put two battery ends to a motor and it spins! wow!) so I hope one day I could learn how to actually use a resistor and a soldering iron. Are there any beginners&#8217; kits around that are actually easy to use?</p>
