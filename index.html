      <p>&#8220;In the future, just about everyone will be driving an electric car.&#8221;  I really appreciate the sentiment of this: Electrics are mechanically simpler, driveability is better, etc. But, is it really reasonable to carry around a third of the vehicle mass in the form of a battery and its associated structure?  It&#8217;s more rational to carry around that energy in a much more dense and more easily stored and dispensed form, like a liquid fuel (which does not need to be fossil-derived gasoline).  It will refuel faster and have much greater range. </p>

      <p>This thing is cool.  the next step to a low cost, low power laptop for note taking students and that.  I don&#8217;t recall if the nokia has sound support, I&#8217;d only assume it does.  If this is true, while critics are saying that its lack of an integrated cell phone will hurt sales, this device has crazy potential being ip based.  knowing this, I can&#8217;t wait until ppl start loading VoIP clients on them.  haha no more cell phones!  (thank god!)  Maybe the next version will play videos too!</p>
