      <p>Just for theory&#8217;s sake&#8230; this works as mostly a low pass filter in mechanical space, no? The higher frequencies that shimmy and wobble in the lathe still do to the same degree but are greatly damped by the increased mass giving a better surface finish &#8211; and a &#8220;resonance rigidity&#8221; above a certain point, but if say there were resonant subharmonics of the motor at let&#8217;s say 20Hz less so. In practice probably a non issue.. but just wondering.</p>

      <p>That&#8217;s cool, but it appears he is using vector maps.  They&#8217;re nice for most uses, but raster maps have navigation details that vector maps lacks.  This can mean the difference between safely navigating reefs versus scrapping bottom or worse.</p>
