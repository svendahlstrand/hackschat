      <p>I&#8217;m sorry. I really am, and I hate to be the guy yelling &#8220;this is not a hack!&#8221; But, seriously, how is this in the scope of Hackaday? This is handicraft. Does hacking even in the broad sense of the word that Hackaday embraces now include hacking away at wood?</p>

      <p>well, while i admit i don&#8217;t know much about quadcopters, would a super low strength magnetic field array work? i heard about something like that used before in the razer hydra pc motion controller, where the base tracks the hand sticks by such a method. not sure how it could be implemented, but to toss an idea out, a swarm of copters with designated locators to get the area information and act as directors for the rest in the swarm, all of them knowing where each other is by that field array. just a thought</p>

      <p>It would be cool if someone did this with a mirror, a small magnet, and some coils to make a portable ipod laser projector. Put the mirror on a pivot then connect one channel to one axis and the other to the other axis. Or it could be really fancy with audio filters to produce even more interesting light effects.</p>
