      <p>The example that you use to prove that this is not the first time a projection TV has ben converted into a multitouch is wrong.  In the article you link to, it clearly states that he built the enclosure to resemble a commercial projection TV.  He does state you probably could use a commercial rear projection TV, but until now I haven&#8217;t seen it done.</p>
