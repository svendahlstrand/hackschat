      <p>Cool, but I would to say that the challenge is your computer which you are monitoring from have also an rf waves, how do you catch the all others rf but not yours, it can influence the results mostly when your  target is not so far from you. I now also that it exists some covers which can stop the waves and make some perturbations on your results</p>

      <p>Haha fancy little thing, looks like it&#8217;s humping the cup every time it refills the paint. I&#8217;m amazed at how &#8220;accurate&#8221; it is while wobbling away, brushing, on a fishing line. At times the friction is enough to turn the bot itself.</p>

      <p>I have recently started programming for an ARM Cortex-M3 (LPC1768). It is great to have the added processing power and peripherals, no more time spent wondering if it&#8217;s possible to cram that extra function in. Yesterday i finally managed to get it to send stack traces to a PC when it crashes, really helps debugging. I could buy a real debugger but that requires money, and i lack money =(.</p>

      <p>Very cool project. I was shocked because actually I was doing something quite similar this week. My idea was to build a small platform to teach control theory and what I do is to control a three wire computer fan from an arduino using transistors scavenged from a broken PC power supply to drive the motor and to buffer the pulse encoder signal from the fan. I should write something about this one of these days because I want to document it for the workshop. I&#8217;ll tell you as soon as I do.</p>
