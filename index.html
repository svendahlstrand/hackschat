      <p>Interesting project. I&#8217;ve also used 3D printed housings for underwater projects. However, one never knows whether they are truly watertight. Often water creeps in between layers etx. I&#8217;d recommend laser cut acrylic. Any leak is immediately visible!</p>

      <p>Is it just me or is the fact that someone is selling knowledge is kind of irrelevant to HaD? I mean, I&#8217;m all in to pay for a good education and everything but this ain&#8217;t in the true spirit of &#8220;sharing&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve never seen HaD posting about the great education system we have here and there so why should we bother with someone doing it online? Am I missing something here? If it&#8217;s the case,I&#8217;d be happy to change my mind but until then, free knowledge is the only way we should go for knowledge.</p>
