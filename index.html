      <p>One interesting thing about wristwatches is the amount of drift that occurs when the watch is taken off at night. This is as a result of temperature changes. When worn,  the human body tends to keep the temperature pretty constant.  This is particularly noticeable in electronic units that are very stable when kept at a near constant temperature.  Mechanical units should also display a discrepancy,  but the general inaccuracy may mask this effect.</p>

      <p>Hey speaking of AVR flash&#8230;  does anyone have experience writing to the flash of e.g. atemga32 from application memory?  apparently, you have to make a function to write, save it in the bootloader portion of memory, then call to it from your application.  Does anyone have any examples of this?  It will help a great deal here.  Thank you.</p>

      <p>Those xbee radios rock, btw. If you&#8217;re only using two, you don&#8217;t even have to program anything, they default to acting like a dumb serial link. Send a few commands, tho, and you can talk to any number of them at a time, they are really easy to use!</p>

      <p>Nice little trick. I thought about doing something like this not long back but decided not to simply because I think they would break too easily in cold weather. Still pretty fun to look at though.</p>
