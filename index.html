      <p>The problem is the LM35 used this way can be + or &#8211; 2 degrees out adding the variances on the device and on the arduino chip. That means it can be as much as 4 degrees hotter or colder than what is recorded . There are a thousand different devices on the market that do the same job better and for less cost probably.  How old is this? I was playing with these 4  years ago!.</p>

      <p>This is a great post, but I disagree that the holidays are &#8220;long over&#8221; &#8211; our Christmas tree is still up, and I can&#8217;t be the only one!  (on that note, I find it bizarre that the huge buildup to Christmas in America goes on for more than a month, but the holiday is pushed aside the moment it&#8217;s over to make room for clearance sales and useless top-10 lists!)</p>
