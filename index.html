      <p>Without a suspension it rode rough as hell. It took a few more years of BMX and bike suspensions to get it together. I rode the monorail at Disneyland in &#8217;65 to realize that it too didn&#8217;t glide along, but was rather a bumpy ride. If you watch the video be prepared to turn the audio way up 25dB, I didn&#8217;t.</p>

      <p>Impressive engineering for sure, but I must say that my dreams don&#8217;t include moving down the road at 1-2 km/hr. :-)  The company would be better served if they cut back a bit on the self-importance and grandiose factor in their marketing (&#8220;dreams&#8221;, &#8220;flying&#8221;, &#8220;freedom&#8221;, &#8230;) and focused more on the engineering or fun aspects of the product.</p>

      <p>i was disappointed in that, it is just some sort of wiz-bang display to put on a head-unit. I was hoping for a real audio spectrum analyzer that has dbu vs freq, adjustable BW, etc for optimizing amplifiers.</p>
