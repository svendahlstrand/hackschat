      <p>Which would you rather hear music performed in? A an anechoic chamber or B the Royal Concertgebouw or Symphony Hall Boston? Two of the worlds greatest sound spaces with fantastic reflections and ambiance.  It&#8217;s Steely Dan versus live sound. Having been in one of A, the strangest thing I heard is when two speakers were in opposite corners and I stood in the center. The speakers went from being in the corners to sounding like they were on my ears like headphones. </p>

      <p>Holy crap. I actually am tired of my Super Jolly which doesn&#8217;t have a shot timer but a doser timer. I am going to build my own timer system, but this seems like incredible overkill, though it&#8217;s pretty similar to the Mazzer Super Jolly timer. I&#8217;m doing this project instead: </p>
