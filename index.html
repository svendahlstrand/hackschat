      <p>Not nearly this level of quality or sophistication, but I made one once with two 24V switching laptop power-supplies, and one of the nicest aspects I hadn&#8217;t planned originally was that they could have separate ground-outputs (make sure they&#8217;re not grounded through your AC&#8217;s outlets!) &#8230; Connect one&#8217;s positive to the other&#8217;s negative, and you got up to +48V, or use that connection as &#8220;ground&#8221; and you&#8217;ve got +-24V&#8230; (beware, some/most(?) regulators and possibly even switching don&#8217;t work with reverse-current; e.g. tying their grounds together, running one at 3V and the other at 5V, then trying to run a 2V load across the two, the current flowing into the 3V regulator will bring its output up to 5V; no current.)</p>

      <p>I could do with this. I have a &#8216;B&#8217; standard Centrino lappie and am finding it a bit slow, with all the other computers on the network being &#8216;G&#8217;. So I could get a USB adaptor and do this mod, and get a good signal, with it being out of sight around the back. I can&#8217;t stand those PCMCIA cards which stick out so much and constantly flash.</p>
