      <p>We should just put up a barter system where people can trade items instead. I&#8217;m sure i have tons of useless things to me that someone else would want and vice versa. Like i have two PXI-1031 chassis from NI that i dont even use anymore just sitting here in my room taking up space. Would love to trade it for something i would actually use.</p>

      <p>Looks like he&#8217;s using the 74LS08 as a makeshift current source.  LS logic typically is limited to around 1mA Ioh, whereas most modern MCUs can drive between 25-50mA per pin.  Combined with the RC network it makes a low pass filter, in place of the LC chebychev filter specified in the linked article on DDS.  LS logic also has asymetrical outputs, however.  They can usually sink an order of magnitude more current than they can source, which means that the rising edge of signals will be filtered more than the falling edge.</p>

      <p>Very unique and cool!  To improve playability, I would suggest pulling the trigger to turn on the laser, increasing the detection area, and maybe adding some gun audio sounds.  A counter that starts after the first can goes down and ends after the last can would be cool too ;-)  Shortest time mode, or even TIMED mode with increasing levels of difficulty.</p>

      <p>snakebots are cool. i made one with a group at the end of the first year of my ee-study at the university here. it used one engine per joint, and all the segments were the same (one uC, one motor, connector in front, connector in back) and could be connected in any order. the nice thing of the design was: powersupply allowing, you could split the snake in two and both ends would become an independent snake. Too bad I don&#8217;t have any info of it online anymore.</p>

      <p>Well it looks like an impressive technical feat, but i have to question the practicality of it.  There are plenty of CD-based mp3 players for cars (I have one), or you can by a cheap stereo with an Aux-input and then get a personal mp3 player like an Ipod or what have you. That would be a lot cleaner, practical, and cheaper if you bought everything from scratch.   Not to mention easier.</p>
