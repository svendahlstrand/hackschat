      <p>Thanks for posting this. I posted a question on one of my project logs about the OSMC open source motor controller, but didn&#8217;t get any responses. Maybe with a bit more exposure I&#8217;ll find someone with some experience. Has anyone built or used one? I need a controller with higher continuous current capabilities, but I am concerned about the heat sinking. </p>
