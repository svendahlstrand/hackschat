      <p>I just got rid of mine this week!  The room I do a lot of computing in gets kinda of dark at night.  With the keyboard even at the lowest level, it brightened up the room so it was hard to get any work done with the &#8220;lamp&#8221; shining in my face.</p>

      <p>You shouldn&#8217;t need the extra lamp for this. I have an app on my iPhone that watches my face to tell me my pulse quite accurately. I have others that work my illuminating my finger using the built-in flash/light. They work extremely well. It&#8217;s funny because I actually just posted about using them on my blog totally coincidentally.</p>

      <p>Completely agree on Mouser.  Shouldn&#8217;t have to use 3rd party scripts to get basic functionality out of a website.  That being said, Digikey (and Mouser) don&#8217;t really cater to much to the hobbyist.  They are looking for the manufacturer that is large enough to need some bulk, but small enough to not make individual contracts with major companies for parts.</p>
