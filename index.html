      <p>No wonder it runs much faster using an arduino, seeing as the PIC on the Basic stamp needs to parse the Basic code every time it&#8217;s run. It&#8217;s probably the most stupidly designed microcontroller setup around, Raping that poor PIC every time.</p>

      <p>I have never been a fan of about.com until today. I usually find lots of their unrelated articles when doing a search for something. This article is great, I have never played with ferrofluid because it is so expensive. I think one of my next projects now is to make a batch of the stuff. Thanks!</p>

      <p>The application notes in the 7805 datasheet state you should use capacitors on the input and output sides of the regulator. Also, depending on the amount of current required by the PSP &#8211; it may be wise to attach a heatsink to the 7805. For battery powered applications &#8211; it may be a better idea to use an LM2940-5 regulator because it requires less input voltage than the 7805 (5.75 V compared to 7 V) and has built-in thermal overload protection.</p>
