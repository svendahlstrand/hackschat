      <p>It is too bad to ruin an expensive set of these telephones.  They are designed to be networked and switched but most importantly can be run on sound power alone.  I recall they run at something like 1800ohm or even far above as the high impedance means you could for instance clip into an insulated barbed wire fence and ground to make a phone network as I recall in a HAD article a few years ago.  I believe the standard field telephone also has an adapter to jack directly into PSTN as needed  but with the call priority keys, the spec is super flexible as I recall.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to make one of these with a solar panel and put it next to a creek near where I live. I&#8217;d have it chirp out the depth / flow rate of the water every hour or two. Maybe I&#8217;ll build and place it eventually. I just want to make sure it falls under the part 15 rules, which is honestly a little intimidating to me.</p>
