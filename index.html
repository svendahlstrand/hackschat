      <p>3 times I have submitted the work done at forum.bongofish.co.uk dealing with the reverse engineering of tablet pc wacom panels.  All of the instructions and software to do this yourself are provided; there is even a wiki.  One forum member even used the info to put a wacom digitizer in an android tablet.  I understand that you guys get a lot of tips, but to see an undocumented video on here when I&#8217;ve submitted so much source material is like seeing a video of someone&#8217;s xbox laptop on hackaday without any mention of the Ben Heck forums.</p>
