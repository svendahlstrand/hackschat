      <p>I&#8217;d like to see someone produce WPA2 for PalmOS 5. Palm had it as an &#8220;enterprise&#8221; update for (IIRC) the T|X but it&#8217;s apparently completely unobtainable now. Dunno if any other Palm device with built in WiFi is WPA2 capable. Same deal for Palm devices with SDIO, far as I can remember, any WiFi cards that worked in a Palm, didn&#8217;t have WPA2 support, and they would have been not very useful because they had no storage.</p>

      <p>Can it help me find those old HDDs with about 20-30 btc from back when it was so easy to mine and a trip to one of several online bitcoin faucets would dump something like 5btc for your wallet(to generate interest among non-miners), but that total was worth only a few American cents back then.  Can it do that?</p>

      <p>The post mentions that this can be accomplished at &#8220;a little more expense&#8221; without the effort. I assume the author is referring to the commercially available unit. Unfortunately, it is much more than a little more expensive. The nikon unit is over $700, pete&#8217;s can be made for about 1/17th of that.</p>
