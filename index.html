      <p>I made one a few years ago, using a shop vac, I used it with my CNC router and to clean the floor in my work shop, I found you do still need a filter because any light and fluffy stuff or fine powder will still make to past the cyclone dust collector, I hated cleaning the clogged shop vac filter every other month, so what I did was to cut the paper from the shop vac filter and replace the filter paper with aluminum window screen, then have the shop vac exhaust vented outside.</p>

      <p>that&#8217;s some brilliant timing, i impulse bought a gp2d12 along with some other stuff last week. saw some on a robot at work and thought it might be cool to play with. my intention is to combine it with a vibration motor on the palm of a glove, so that you can &#8216;feel&#8217; things with a spooky sixth sense. could also work as a cheapo parking sensor&#8230;</p>
