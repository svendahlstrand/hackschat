      <p>I have played with two tape measure strips used as alinear actuator. I was inspired by the linear actuator design of [Roger rabbit]. I put velcro/hook and loop on the inner faces of the tape and forced them together to give it more cooperative strength but still allows them to be pulled apart when retracted. It was fun but needs careful guidance and support of the tape to get it to extend, rather than unravel inside the drums / voids around the storage reels. I used two but I think the curved metal tape would lend itself to a third tape, potentially making a stronger beam in more lateral loading directions (and less prone to buckling from longitudinal loads). If you could apply the extending drive to the tape itself, rather than the storage reels, as I did, I think it would work better.</p>
