      <p>Started learning BASIC at University of Utah  in 1975. Paid a buck an hour for access to a row of teletype machines converted to I/O terminals connected to s Univac 1108. Will always remrmber that &#8220;shook shook shook&#8221; as you typed input and then rapid newroom clatter on printouts. Was also a DEC LA120 with pin printer and a Tek graphics terminal, but they were both usually busy all the time.</p>

      <p>I wouldn&#8217;t trust those spring loaded clips in any sort of mobile application. There is a reason battery packs are welded, and it is that trying to put large amounts of current through a weenie spring loaded contact like that will quickly result in fried contacts. This is especially dangerous when you have intermittent contacts, because you end up with one charged cell (with a bad contact) surrounded by discharged cells, so when the pack cools back down and the contact reconnects you generate large amounts of current as the cells equalize which results in further contact degradation and possibly a battery fire. Throw in some corrosion (inevitable in a vehicle unless the battery is in an airtight container with desiccant pack) and I bet the pack won&#8217;t last through 1 winter.</p>

      <p>I am curious where this will go. This video was posted quite some time back. And there are other games with similar glitches (some are even intended). Since the software on theses systems can be considered tiny compared to modern operating systems, it might be interesting to check the games formally for invariants (and so on). Nintendo checked the games before they were released. It would be very interesting to know, what kind of checks they performed back then. If anybody has further information on that topic, it would be great if you could share. BR</p>
