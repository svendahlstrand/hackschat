      <p>Man that is a beautifully retro looking machine. There is something so special design wise about sheet metal only cases, where its nothing but some nice smooth bends, and a couple well placed screws. Makes me think of the early 60&#8217;s super computers.</p>

      <p>I was faced with the same dilemma a few years back: Got a 6&#8243; Meade Newtonian for 80$ because the controller was missing. However, this was a certain transition model so no of the available, used or new, replacement controllers were compatible. My quick and dirty hack was ripping an old tape drive apart to scavenge its beefy stepper controller IC, soldering to a stepper motor from a printer and using an overly precise crystal controlled frequency generator to control the speed. This hack cost nothing and worked more precisely than the original RA DC motor.</p>

      <p>RF is RF. If you can get a nice low noise signal out with low harmonics you can amplify to your heart&#8217;s content. Pretty impressive to be getting reasonably high-quality FM out of a GPIO pin on a $30 board.</p>

      <p>I saw this coming so I have never used or implemented OAuth. Entity security is a constant battle between actual security level and user convenience. It the convenience of OAuth that has made it popular and not the security. Tokenised authentication can never work  with a single verified token (the email address in this case). Paypal has some weaknesses like this to. </p>

      <p>Sorry, couldn&#8217;t help myself. That&#8217;s sorta cool. Very retro. Makes me want to pull my 1970&#8217;s EE Desk reference and build something out of it. If only they would have built a giant retro bell(I&#8217;m thinking Liberty Bell sized) to wake up by. I know I need something like that!</p>

      <p>Are you kidding? You posted this? I hacked my tivo over the thanksgiving holiday, and it wasn&#8217;t pretty, we&#8217;re talking over 150 page threads over at the tivo forums, almost 2 years worth of posts. Its a lot to go through. I thought wow, hackaday posted a one stop shop for doing this, great!</p>
