      <p>About the different tv&#8217;s under the same sku, i highly doubt they use that for &#8220;price fixing&#8221; . It&#8217;s for them the same functional item, seen it&#8217;s re branded stuff anyway (Vizeo has no production lines) most likely they simply have 2 production sources for the same delivery to Best Buy&#8230;</p>
