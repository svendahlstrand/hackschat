      <p>I have played with the mbed implementation of this. I cannot say i have found a good application for it. Sure, you can make some sensors and and get the data directly on the phone if you write an app. But there is a significant delay and you are very limited to what you can send.</p>

      <p>This could be a game changer for autonomous vehicles depending on the computational expense vs. alternative methods. Even if it requires more MIPS, those will likely get less expensive faster than the hardware methods currently in use to reduce computational requirements. I would expect that this method of processing would lend itself to analysis by FPGA?</p>
