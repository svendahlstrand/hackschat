      <p>Whilst self balancers are a very common project, it&#8217;s unusual to see one using steppers. I started one about a year ago to see how well they worked, but it got put on the back burner. It seems they can work pretty well. I must revive my project too.</p>

      <p>Mmm, strange&#8230; I&#8217;ve been buying used UPSes too, and I&#8217;ve had no problems reviving them. All you need to do is to replace the sealed lead accus with completely new ones (which can be a sizey investment &#8211; I know someone who has a nice 19&#8243; APC UPS but has to shell out at least EUR80 to get new but el-cheapo batteries) but then the UPS will be as good as new. I still have an APC here, which can power my server (P3-1000, 4 HD&#8217;s) for at least half an hour. The batteries in them are almost 3 years old by now btw.</p>
