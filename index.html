      <p>&#8220;But the biggest problem with using the Pi in a NAS is that it doesn‚Äôt have any onboard hard drive interface, forcing you to use USB. Not only is this much slower, but doesn‚Äôt leave you a lot of options for cleanly hooking up your drives.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Perhaps it&#8217;s only a stupid phobia I have. In my opinion it&#8217;s not good business to pay for home insurance home brew equipment or not UL listed as this.for switching line current/voltage. Even if such a device isn&#8217;t the cause for a fire, it&#8217;s presence allows the carrier to claim it was to avoid paying for the loss.  Then it&#8217;s up to the insured to take the carrier into civil court.  Lose the suit the insured will have to pay the insurance companies defense cost. everyone has to determine their own comfort level, but should have eyes wide open while doing so.</p>
