    <blockquote>
      <p>The explanation is somewhat off here.  What&#8217;s actually happening is greater oversampling on the Mode-7 texture prior to transformation.  So when performing an arbitrary rotation, instead of each pixel being divided into (say) 16 subpixels, it&#8217;s being split into more like 256.  This makes the resulting rotations and scales much higher precision.</p>

      <p>Has anybody taken this to the next level by using an IMU (like an MPU9250) instead of potentiometers that you&#8217;ll have to attach to your telescope? You point to Polaris for IMU calibration and go from there?</p>

      <p>Gotta love the names of the companies that took their names directly from the product they made. Digital Equipment Corporation made digital equipment. VLSI made Very Large Scale Integration chipsets for IBM clones. SouthWest Technical Products made technical products in the American Southwest. Radio Corporation of America, shouldn&#8217;t need to explain that one&#8230; Motorola? Who the heck could figure out what they made simply by reading the name? Was it motors? Nope.</p>

      <p>The library converts K thermocouple voltage to temperature within  +/- 0.03¬∞C, actually measuring temperature with that accuracy is quite another thing. How much noise/error due to the amplifier? How much due to the ADC? How much due to the cold junction compensation? Also placement of the sensor and ensuring good thermal contact is very important. In real life, anything higher than +/- 0.1¬∞C is very hard to get and in many cases meaningless.</p>

      <p>Actually, it is not illegal to destroy money.  It is illegal to alter money for the purpose of misrepresenting it as more money.  Making this ring is not illegal.  Altering a $5 bill to look like a $20 bill is illegal.  So as long as you don&#8217;t try to pass this off as legal tender you should be OK.</p>
