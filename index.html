      <p>I had this long tirade in my head about how people keep trying to shoehorn touch technologies into &#8220;older&#8221; technologies such as making NES controllers or creating &#8220;buttons&#8221; on touchscreens (Check out the Shining Force by SEGA for Android or any number of like games to see what I mean) but after reading over the link, it actually isn&#8217;t half bad. </p>

      <p>Whoa, noscript in the core? That would be seriously awesome and bypass some of the dance the extension has to do to get it to work (though ff3 improved things). I wonder if they&#8217;re going to make adblock+ features more integrated &#8212; blocking things from known-bad and user-defined hosts would be much easier that way. in fact, that could replace the first few extensions that I install before I actually use the browser&#8230;</p>

      <p>sadly this does NOT allow you to have a free sd slot for other cards, at the end he says you need to stick a card in the slot this is due to a switch that is activated when a card is inserted so the wifi wont work till there is something in the slot&#8230;its a nice idea but i would rather keep my sd wifi card as is so i can use it in any pda</p>
