Such a system, ultra expensive back in the day sometimes found as expensive mil surplus now, was included on B-52s, SR-71s, and Polaris missiles before inertial navigation was so reliable, and even after in the times before GPS as a backup.</p>

      <p>Wow, and &#8220;in my times&#8221; (i&#8217;m 22 :D) all you needed was couple latches. Maybe you youngsters :D don&#8217;t remember that some uCs (8051 anyone?) have a address and data bus avaliable on pins. One latch to demultiplex data from address and you have your 64kbytes worth of address space ready and waiting. Get something (latch toggled by another pin, i2c io expander etc.)to switch between banks and you can get yourself pretty much unlimited memory. And faster than serial too &#8211; if you go with latch method placing it somewhere inside address space you need only 1 write extra.</p>
