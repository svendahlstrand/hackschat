      <p>So I&#8217;m guessing there are no mystery binary blobs in this project like found in ther raspberry Pi so that&#8217;s good.  I also assume the usb port there could be connected to usb devices like another ethernet port or wifi adapter.  If so, this could be a useful low-end router with zero &#8220;mystery&#8221; components leading to high security levels if configured correctly.  Interesting, but ther 64Meg ram limit hurts.</p>

      <p>My biggest suggestion: supply an optional cover that is big enough to snap in place over the breadboarded circuit, shield, etc to protect your circuit. That flat cover looks great but if you&#8217;re using the product you can never use the cover!</p>

      <p>Since so many imitate and infuse themselves with the fashion of a century+ ago, it necessary to point out that then they considered it vulgar to wear such on one&#8217;s wrist. It&#8217;s nothing to have such stuff ruined or snagged off of one&#8217;s wrist when doing ordinary expected tasks. Like hand washing or getting a grip on things.</p>

      <p>That&#8217;s really cool. If you could add a good enough cooling system I wonder how it would compare to something like an SBIG STF-8300, which costs about 2 grand and uses the same chip.</p>

      <p>Cool&#8230; I have an old Compaq 486 laptop that I was considering cross compiling Linux from Scratch for.  Tried using a boot floppy and Puppy linux on a parallel ported ZIP100 disc before that but it wouldn&#8217;t recognise it. This kinda thing is always good for those one-upmanship, difficult linux installs conversations! :P Look forward to part two!</p>

      <p>Bagpipes are pretty rough to learn. Because of the drone pipe, and the fact that the chanters must be in tune with the drone, they&#8217;re often not on a &#8220;standard&#8221; scale. Serious kudos to anyone who can master these things.</p>
