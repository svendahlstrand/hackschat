      <p>This is onather one of those projects that could have done without the &#8216;duino because a envelop detector can be made of just a diode , cap and resistor. I&#8217;m just gonna assume this is what the creator had at hand. I really sincerely hope that is the reason.</p>

      <p>Now all you need is an array of three light sensors with colour filters for each of the nine squares on the side to be twisted coupled with a few white leds or a bulb to act as a source. then it could solve the cube all on it&#8217;s own by flipping it a few times. I bet there is a nice little algorithm somewhere that will let you only have to scan half the sides and compute the others.</p>

      <p>This is an interesting hack that has already been hashed over a few times in several machinists forums.  There&#8217;s a couple projects out there to read multiple calipers at the same time so you can use the cheap  Chinese calipers as DRO&#8217;s (digital readouts) to know the absolute positions of your X/Y/Z/Quill on a vertical/horizontal mill or lathe</p>

      <p>THe emulation hack may well work but I doubt the antenna hack will.  Connecting to ground effectively shorts the antenna thus making it useless rather than improving range.  In particular receive will be amplifying the antenna signal relative to ground thus it will kill the wireless.  It could also damage the transmit amplifier significantly.</p>
