      <p>Indiegogo has said that it is willing to extend the deadline it gave to a project attempting to make a handheld version of a classic British computer..But the crowdfunding site says that the team behind the ZX Spectrum Vega+ has yet to meet its conditions.In February, Indiegogo threatened to appoint debt collectors if the campaign had not fulfilled its commitments by the end of May. The project&#8217;s chief told the BBC he was &#8220;still determined to deliver&#8221;.</p>

      <p>Useful tool. I wonder, though, if it needs to be as complex as this? I feel like maybe you could mill two brass blocks about a half inch square with 1.75mm/3mm semicircular grooves, place the pieces of filament in between them with the ends butted together, and heat them up with a soldering iron? I guess if you had hundreds of little scraps to fuse together, a dedicated tool would be better, but is that really a situation anyone is finding themselves in? I used to keep the little bits of leftover filament at the end of a reel until I bothered to calculate it and found it was usually less than 40 cents&#8217; worth. I can afford to throw that away.</p>
