      <p>i wish monitors (or gpu&#8217;s?) wouldn&#8217;t take so long to switch to another source. I imagine back in the VGA days the monitor would probably need to scan a few fields to average some signal threshold levels etc., and the CRT would need some time to setup and settle new amplifier settings and signal timings or whatnot. But i cannot imagine there&#8217;s an excuse nowadays for it to take a full 2-3 seconds to switch to another high speed digital link.</p>

      <p>Great Idea. A recommendation: The front ring of the dial can be turned to adjust the scale so better clamp it on the main housing. The offset is no longer required because it can now be done in software. And please don&#8217;t 3d-print the parts, make them the proper way :)</p>

      <p>Wow, memories. That IBM looks almost exactly like my first x86 machine, circa 1991. The only visible difference is that mine had a full-height 10 megabyte MFM hard drive instead of the second floppy. I had almost as much fun taking that thing apart and putting it back together as I did running programs on it.</p>

      <p>I really admire this kind of work because IMO it&#8217;s the best way to go.  It hides under the dashboard and the turbo under the hood.  It looks like anyone else&#8217;s car, so it doesn&#8217;t stick out as something Joe Criminal should steal, but it still has added functionality that&#8217;s so smooth it could have (and should have; wtf is up with automakers?) been done that way from the factory.</p>
