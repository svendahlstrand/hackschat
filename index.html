      <p>I&#8217;ve been interested into getting into FPGAs for a while, but have never had a use case for them. Most of the embedded projects I work on can either be solved by microcontrollers for low-level stuff, or by a desktop (or raspberry pi, even) for the higher level stuff.</p>

      <p>Hells bells! I actually remember seeing that film. It came out in the month of November in 1996. I saw it with my dad, (visiting my dad and stepmom, she didn&#8217;t tag along.) It was a heck of a great romp. And [Alan] that&#8217;s an excellent use of technology.</p>
