      <p>fun concept, but when I first saw the hackaday image of the radio case. I thought &#8220;wow! That&#8217;s a nice case, cool design&#8230; and in wood, nice job&#8221; but I can&#8217;t see the case in the article. It looks to me that a 3D rendering is the only thing there is. So in other words&#8230; nothing in wood (yet) only some intentions of a case in wood filament, which I&#8217;m very curious how that will look like. As the design itself is very pretty and I hope a video will come online of the final result. Now this is a cliffhanger! (well done)</p>

      <p>I have that display running on dsPIC33, initially using a port of MSP430 example code that came with it, then a total rewrite with optimizations and some extra features.  Was a fun three-day project.  Though looking at the video demo, [Tahmid]&#8217;s port is nicer.  Looks to be well optimized too, running very close to the maximum possible drawing speed.  Well done!</p>

      <p>Well in fairness the GPIO pins on the Pi alone will let you use the Pi without a keyboard or mouse. Still I can see how having a portable interface with a display would be convenient. Things like the PiFace and PiTFT do a good job throwing convenient buttons and visual feedback into the mix :)</p>

      <p>i&#8217;ve always wanted to slip one of these into my luggage before an airplane trip, just to see how much abuse my suitcase gets. once i bought a $300 samsonite suitcase, the next week i took my first trip with it and they&#8217;d managed to destroy two of the zippers and wrench off one wheel bracket. it was only an 800 mile trip, and i happen to know my suitcase was the only one on the plane, and it took 1.5 hours to get from the plane to baggage claim&#8230;never fly delta into atlanta (which is the same as saying &#8220;never fly delta&#8221;).</p>
