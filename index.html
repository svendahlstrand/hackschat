      <p>There is something afoul, methinks. When one compares the sound quality between the old MegaMidi-video and this, one has to notice that the current video demonstrates noise/hissing on the audio signal. At least according to what I hear here through my speakers, this cannot qualify as a musical instrument.</p>

      <p>Nice job! I build a first prototype to do the same a few years ago with two main flaws. first obvious and easily to change: I used a 9DOF sensor with resulting Bad angular resolution and lots of drift. Second was the sensor. The moment I find a sensor like in this hack with a resolution of around +-1,5mm I can finally switch away from my unit-e laser range finder with a sample rate of ~0.5 points per second :D</p>

      <p>Isn&#8217;t there an advantage to having the synthesis algorithms/logic run on an FPGA? That would allow very complex sounds to be synthesized. I wonder why nobody has done it. Maybe its not required after all. Just a thought.</p>
