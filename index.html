      <p>Both Firefox and Chrome teams have been talking about adding Serial communication in the browser. I would much rather have that  (or even mBed&#8217;s method of downloading a .bin and drag and dropping it to the uC) than having to hook it up to an ethernet shield. It&#8217;s a rather expensive component for an affordable microcontroller and isn&#8217;t exactly plug-and-play. Not that I think it&#8217;s a bad idea or anything, just that it should probably not be targeted at beginners.</p>
