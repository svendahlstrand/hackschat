      <p>The set-up of this experiment looks suspicious to me. What is stopping the microphone and it&#8217;s long cable from picking up the monitor EMI, instead of just the monitor sound?</p>

      <p>It looks really cool. I always apreciated this kind of projects. My mom may need a prostectic knee in a few years. I always wonder if i could make an externat exo-skeleton like knee, to extend the life of her knee and relief the contant pain that she suffers when she walk.</p>

      <p>YES, this is the same i suggest on my site to use pololu instead ULN2803, it will cheaper than TB6560; of course is needed to configure pin outs to drive endstops and spindle&#8230; Using arduino seems to be  that it will be the standard for 3D print, laser engraving and CNC. This week I will post for mach3 usage.</p>

      <p>See, not everything on this website must be ugly hacks as demanded by some of it&#8217;s readers! If you have so much pride in your work that even when you take on a personal project you make sure it looks good and works good by following sound design principles, then all the kudos to you!</p>

      <p>been there, done that. although I added a line from the power to go to the computer end. I did this so I could power the cheapo tablet while it was OTG&#8217;ing the hub when I had USB memory, mouse and keyboard connected.</p>
