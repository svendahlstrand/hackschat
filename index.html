      <p>Hmm, I went to this exhibit here in Osaka a few months back. Personally, I wasn&#8217;t impressed by any of it. Based on the reputation of the artist, I expected far more than what I saw. In this specific installation, most of the sensors were inoperable as they were displayed. You had to reach into the jacket and wave your hand around to activate the sounds. However they had signs posted prohibiting touching. It was frustrating understanding how it was built and being prohibited from making it work as it was intended to work. I understand they don&#8217;t want a bunch of people touching art. That&#8217;s very reasonable. Having interactive art that can&#8217;t be interacted with is poorly thought out.</p>
