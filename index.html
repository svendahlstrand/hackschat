      <p>I cant tell, but it doesn&#8217;t look like it measures voltage &#8211; only current. The voltage on the grid fluctuates quite a bit depending on the load in the area, wouldn&#8217;t be too accurate.</p>

      <p>Well Derek has an ongoing process to perfect his hack. In event he does or doesn&#8217;t find a 90 degree connector he will have to again to make another case, or mod this one. With finding a connector it will still be an obtrusion. Without find a connector he will have to hack is own solution for the connection, that most likely be an obtrusion as well.  Both will require a case mod to protect the connection, while a slight bump most likely will remain, but shouldn&#8217;t pose any hassle.  No doubt Derek will get this to close as perfect as possible.  In the video Derek didn&#8217;t say he actually measured the fields around the device, but said his research revealed they shouldn&#8217;t be high enough to pose a threat to card magnetic stripes. One of those things that everyone has to decide their own comfort level</p>
