      <p>I&#8217;m really interested to see what will happen with 3d printing as time goes on. There&#8217;s going to be some huge social issues with people creating things in their own home that the government believes shouldn&#8217;t be obtainable. Gun parts. Drugs. Who knows what else we&#8217;ll be able to make in our own home just by printing something off the internet.</p>
