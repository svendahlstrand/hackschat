      <p>I&#8217;ve built a couple of GB carts for development, but they were all EPROM based (not EEPROM, EPROM).  Combined with a little logic, I could make the thing scroll down whatever image I wanted, then flip to the official Nintendo logo for checksumming.  :-)  Not my idea, but I improved upon it a little.  There are some other dev kits around too that will let you take a GBA and do robotics projects with it.</p>
