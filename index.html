      <p>I really like the gentler haptic like feel of a motorised rotary switch so the little reed relay clicks would be nice too with just a little magnetic cogging too. Of course one could do most in software using quadrature and semiconductors and with tiny magnets around the axis too but, for some instrument applications the reed switch wins out though only for lower voltages if directly connected ie off is really off no nA leakage. Nothing wrong with feeding the reed switches to big relays school as for mains cycling serious load testing &#8211; though in that case delay/timing would be helpful, don&#8217;t want to see power relays go nuts when spinning the dial &#8211; except on destructive testing regimes naturally :D</p>

      <p>Nice! Partly related question : has anyone seen plans for a small battery powered IR adapter? It would take input from your favorite remote (or phone with IR like recent Samsung galaxy phones) and output IR user set IR signals for some home device. You&#8217;d also need a way to record the IR codes for the target device. I know there are learnable multi remotes already of course. But with this idea ANY remote, with the design you like, could be used.</p>

      <p>A nice write up &#8230; but after reading the linked Freescale app note, it doesn&#8217;t seem like there was much originality here.  Simply ported an excellently written app note from C# to an arduino library (which they did well&#8230;. just want to makee sure credit is given where due&#8230;)</p>
