      <p>these are legal, but they can have serious implications if you use them to pirate satellite tv. I know it&#8217;s just an ISO-7816 interface and not an unlooper, but if you write any pirat3 war3z for an interface like this, prepare to be served with a lawsuit if you don&#8217;t post anonymously. the satellite companies have been suing for decades and if you naively post any DIY involving sat, even if it doesn&#8217;t actually amount to pirating, you will get hit severely. most people who do this already know, but I&#8217;m saying this just in case a normal hardware modder puts 1 and 1 together and experiments.</p>
