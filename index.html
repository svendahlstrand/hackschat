      <p>It&#8217;s possible that the aluminized foam board didn&#8217;t make  a good faraday cage because the panels were not electrically connected. The oxide layer on the aluminum, or any protective coating on it, would prevent good electrical contact and could form a slot antenna.</p>

      <p>To think, just how easy we have it these days. I always told people how it was when everything was salvaged from junk, or ordered from a paper catalog, with 4-6 week shipping, after you pay with a paper check mailed in with your order form. Radio Shack was the local source&#8230;</p>

      <p>I also tried this a year ago. (you can find it somewhere in the Austrian RepRap forums) The problem with this is the high surface tension. The tin always creates small drops. I used 99% tin 3mm solder wire for this I think. Another problem is that most nozzles are made out of copper but tin sticks very well to copper. A design with an Aluminium nozzle is better for this purpose like the one from arcol.hu. Aluminum creates instantly an oxid-film on contact with oxygen so it is nearly impossible to solder. (you can improve this effect by eloxation of the nozzle) To get rid of the surface tension of tin an idea would be to print in oil.</p>
