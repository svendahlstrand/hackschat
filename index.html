      <p>Plastic living hinges like the tic tac lid are amazing. For such a thin little piece of plastic, it always surprises me that they don‚Äôt fail after one of two flexes. A sauce bottle or a shampoo bottle can last way longer than it feels like it should. </p>

      <p>Very interesting. The article claims this will make it a &#8220;ridiculously powerful&#8221; transmitter. Define &#8220;ridiculous&#8221;. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s in the order of a few mW and if that&#8217;s the case, you don&#8217;t need a ham license to transmit so long as it adheres to FCC part 15 rules (think of the kits Radio Shack sold back in the day). If you want to run more power then yes, you&#8217;ll need a license. [Source: myself, n0xmz]</p>
