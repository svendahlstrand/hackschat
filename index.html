      <p>That is something interesting for radio amateurs, which i am not. It is no more miracle to have speak with someone that far away when internet is here. Yes, you need knowledge and skill, but it is like to choose travel around the world on bicycle when you can fly. It is just setting of difficulty.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m curious what he used for a voltage regulator. Most 7805s and similar chips have a voltage drop between 1.25v and 2v. Theoretically, 6v should be insufficient voltage to do the job.</p>

      <p>I actually did something similar some time ago with my ancient 3Com homeconnect DSL modem. The device has a serial port that was password protected; a simple hardware hack to get the password and a serial cable connected to the linux box serves the same purpose. With the added bonus that I set up a simple web page to check the modem&#8217;s status, current link rate and the option to manually resync the link or reboot the modem.</p>
