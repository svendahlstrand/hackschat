Great idea.  32 gig for a ipad?  what a waste, I&#8217;ve already got 64 gig in there, I&#8217;m looking to carry a lot more or have a pocket wifi file server so I can have a friend copy all the latest ios&#8217;s I found to his laptop.</p>

      <p>Just keep in mind that if you choose to soft-mod your xbox with Mechassault (Go for it, it&#8217;s easy and painless!) make sure you don&#8217;t leave it unplugged for long periods of time, as you will corrupt the Microsoft bios, thereby turning your box into a 130 dollar doorstop until you buy a modchip!  I mention this because I really did my homework before I decided to mod mine, but no one warned me about not leaving it off power.  Imagine my dismay&#8230;.</p>
