      <p>So the WiFi access points need to broadcast a custom SSID, the first three letters in human readable form are &#8220;SPS&#8221;. and then other parts are in non human readable format &#8211; their latitude, longitude and height above or below (depending on the below sea level bit). And then the device calculates where it is in relation to the access points using multilateration (trilateration) by measuring the signal strengths of the access points.</p>

      <p>Hmm, that&#8217;s different.  I&#8217;d think the pressure sensors seen on previous examples would provide better interactivity.  A capacitive sensor can certainly tell if a foot&#8217;s on it.  And maybe also number of feet or even type of footwear, but altering the lightshow based on that isn&#8217;t as intuitive as doing it by how hard someone is stepping down &#8211; which this method can&#8217;t detect.</p>

      <p>Hmm. Definately Will think about this mod. Still think that it has to be easier (on you the person, same diff in the project) to use something like a bright RED so that your night vision in the room isnt shot the instant a remote is triggered.</p>
