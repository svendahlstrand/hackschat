      <p>I was looking at a couple of controllers for a project at the weekend and found them both wanting so parked it.  Then here is this post &#8211; ideal. Bosh &#8211; sorted. Board on its way.</p>

      <p>Holy cow.  I&#8217;ve used OpenSCAD for quick things and objects that lend themselves nicely to parameterization (eg. mounting brackets, etc).  But THIS is dedication :)</p>

      <p>Neat &#8211; I&#8217;m in the middle of a similar thing using a teensy for keyboard side and Elgato cam-link for the video, which is a bit pricier.  After digging a little, though &#8211; why does this writeup repeatedly mention *mouse* support? Fmstrat&#8217;s page doesn&#8217;t mention it, or as far as I can tell, implement it &#8211; as far as I know, linux &#8220;gadget&#8221; support can do one device, not a hub, so figuring out how to do both mouse and keyboard with a single pi-zero would be *really* interesting.  (Not faulting Fmstrat&#8217;s project, still very useful, but I *am* faulting your misleading writeup.  Please try and be a little more careful about not inventing features&#8230;)</p>

      <p>Yeah that is a shame, not supporting Icestorm, it makes it a bit of an asshat as far as hats go. Still better than nothing and it has educational value.</p>
