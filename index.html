      <p>Well, as one who snored for years, I got tested and found out that I had Sleep Apnea.  My test results determined that I was having around 15,000 breathing disturbances per night.  Got fitted for a Sleep Apnea mask and unit and was tested on  the first few nights using it.  That 15,000 disturbances were reduced to 1 [one] and my snoring disappeared.</p>

      <p>I wonder if you could use this to activate one of those Japanese piston masturbators. It&#8217;d work as an on/off switch of course, but I wonder if you could be in the right frame of mind to keep it turned on. I think I have a new project.</p>

      <p>that is one of the most clever ideas on displaying information i&#8217;ve ever seen. i love these novel ways of displaying information without a regular add-on lcd. one of my other fav was somebody using a multipmeter to display number information by generating a frequency and the frequency was displayed. good job alberto! keep them comin&#8217;</p>
