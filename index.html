      <p>What about C64 and 128? 2 different mouse styles existed and depending on the software used like GEOS. One style is like joystick where the mouse sends pulses for up, down, left, and right and were used where joystick were used for controlling cursor like early drawing program and a few games. Other style is the the proportional mode and requires program to correctly use this one like GEOS.</p>

      <p>Those few tones and the sketch together take up how much of the ~ 32k bytes that UNO has? Sketch looks to be ~3 kb, includes the Volume library too. Not too bad! 8 bit was focused on making a lot of great tones / music with 3 basic, very tiny in size &#8220;instruments&#8221;. Setting aside the fact that the UNO should just have more flash memory, this feels like a decent way of generating music / effects. Any way to import music into it or create a standard set of notes?</p>

      <p>Neat. There was a time when a component was a resistor or transistor or a switch. We called these kinds of things &#8220;ICs&#8221; or &#8220;chips&#8221;. How many old-school &#8220;components&#8221; do you suppose are in this device?</p>

      <p>I bought a bunch of Megatron 816 TC trackballs for $10 each on ebay a few years ago. There&#8217;s plenty of documentation available, including technical drawings to cut your own faceplate. You can  supply your own buttons. They use some kind of standard serial protocol (other versions of those trackballs use PS/2, USB&#8230;) and worked with a handmade cable right away with Linux. They work well for a kiosk style application, but I just couldn&#8217;t imagine using them day to day integrated in my desk &#8211; they just don&#8217;t feel precise enough.</p>
