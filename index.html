      <p>now he should take some industrial acrylic sealant and buff it over the case to give it that shine again.  color looks great in the pics, but the texture makes it look bad IRL I bet.  I had a similar excursion with the original wii-mote before colored ones were available.  The sandpaper method really is the best and only way to get an even color.</p>

      <p>Is this &#8220;flat&#8221; in theory or in actuality?  It would make it easier to calibrate for other programs if we knew more about what we had. Can you provide a frequency plot (MLSSA or equiv?) Those Panasonic capsules arent what they say in datasheets, and Im a wee bit dubious of anything based on TL084 being pristine by any means.</p>
