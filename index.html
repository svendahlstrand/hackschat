      <p>W/ some clever software, and that rs232 interface, you could use it to monitor things via instant message&#8230; First thing that comes to my mind is messaging like &#8220;myhottub&#8221; on aim and saying &#8220;temperature&#8221;, and getting a reply back w/ the temp.  It would reqiure a microcontroller for the sensing, but it seems like any data you could get into an rs232 capable controller could be accessed in this manner&#8230; pretty slick.</p>
