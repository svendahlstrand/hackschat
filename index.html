      <p>If not done so here, the best advice I ever took to molding PVC shapes was filling the tube with sand tightly packed, capped, then heated. Then I inhaled as much of the toxins I could so I never actually knew or remembered the work so I assume they were brilliant and now housed at the Louvre.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m making something very similar to that, I bought a remote controlled UFO and I&#8217;m adding more motors for it so it won&#8217;t spin around while flying. Then I&#8217;ll add an Atmega 8 as my micro controller and I&#8217;m thinking of sonar as my sensors or photo resistors. I would have Infrared but sunlight can effects it&#8217;s results. For now ill have it attached to fishing wire so it doesn&#8217;t go too high, but eventually I will add some sort of altimeter.</p>

      <p>wow, looking at the PINK board for the xmas tree- those things are not cheap! At that rate you&#8217;re better off tucking an old optiplex under the tree and dressing it up as an xmas present, and you could probably run it wirelessly for the same cost to boot. Anybody know a cheaper alternative?</p>
