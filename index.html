      <p>The cheap equipment from China, no matter what it is, is a double edged sword. You get the promise of something that works, and you think &#8220;how bad could it be?&#8221;. But when you actually get it, you are getting compromises that you&#8217;d never have made on your own. Stuff that works, but only marginally. Kits that are missing components or have been substituted for lesser or incorrect parts. Some of this stuff isn&#8217;t designed to be used for its intended purpose. It&#8217;s designed to be sold. That being said the quality can be very good, and if you&#8217;re okay with marginal, there can be very good deals. I won&#8217;t start on the documentation issues.</p>

      <p>Well a rework station is expensive if you compare it to chipquik. Especially for one off jobs like this, and for hobbyists. At work we use it for repairs in the field where we usually use gas powered soldering irons and chipquik.</p>

      <p>Is the computer part is in the screen monitor? Or it is in the boombox? If it&#8217;s in the screen monitor.. then it&#8217;s not over yet, add up the hard drive in the boombox and add possiable to repair to audio card to build this better sound (or not).. In the end, Install Unreal Tournament AND HALO multiplayer game inside the BOOMBOX! very loud when you&#8217;re playing right front of it..  It better be adding up 802.11x USB (Just made WirelessUSB) It should also support driver for this&#8230;</p>
