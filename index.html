      <p>Nice work! I&#8217;ve made something extremely similar to this, but had trouble with the PIR modules response duration. The modules, once triggered, maintain a signal for a certain time. The time can be reduced by a small pot on the chip, but even by bridging the connection for no resistance the signal persists for some time, causing a delay. </p>
