      <p>Kflop is great, I installed on on my mill and am using it though the Mach3 plug in. Great support too. Still have a couple little things to work out like my modbus MPG does not work with it. The free interface for the kflop is supposed to be pretty good too, I just have everything how I like it in Mach3 so I dont want to switch.</p>

      <p>Even though I read the details I wonder weather the chip can stay analogue and be scanned at an audio rate and have a &#8220;film sound track&#8221; sample overlay. It would make a keyboard sampler that uses physical samples. I imagine that capacitance or something would limit it to fast scanning though.</p>

      <p>&#8220;&#8230;controlling them &#8230;  means &#8230; messing around with DMX&#8221; &#8211; I don&#8217;t understand what is so hard about this.  DMX is just 250 Kbps UART with an extended break and a RS485 line transceiver.  Extremely Arduino friendly.  Way more so than the WS281x protocol.  Of course commercial DMX lights are way more $$, but that wasn&#8217;t the stated objection.</p>
