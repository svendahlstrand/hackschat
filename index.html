      <p>At first I couldn&#8217;t figure out why the comment about the COP410&#8217;s clock range was there, but then I realized the comment there meant we was hoping for a quick fix of just increasing its input clock speed to speed up the timer.</p>

      <p>I just got my first logic analyzer from a family member for Christmas (as merely a hobbiest, I couldn&#8217;t afford dropping money on one for myself&#8230; I just don&#8217;t have quite enough need) this past year. I wasn&#8217;t involved in the decision-making process (thus the disadvantage of *not* buying for oneself), but the got me a USBee SX series &#8212; it&#8217;s very similar in form factor to this little baby, and I suspect is approximately similar in specifications. Works pretty well to help debug my PIC projects.</p>
