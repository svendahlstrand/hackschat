      <p>Forgive my ignorance, but are the aftermarket repair parts for the N64 joystick that awful? At my game store we replace floppy joysticks with kits like these, and customers seem to love them. We buy them by the ten-pack for $55, but I&#8217;m sure they aren&#8217;t terribly much more expensive individually. </p>
