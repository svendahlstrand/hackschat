      <p>Nice one, HDMI can offer huge variations but, can you make any $ out of it beyond the transient joy of hacking. IOW. Hacking into HDMI with some processing to do something useful can be expensive for the hobbyist Or does it have to be when it comes to cro&#8217;s and development tools &#8211; a comparison chart would be good ?</p>

      <p>Horrible idea inside your home ( I hear no fume extractors).  Potential for fire is very high as well!  In industry we like to call risk reduction engineering control. /sarcasm  But, seriously my buddy was using electromagnetism to snuff fire from candles and ended up setting his apartment on fire. (yah I know stupid shit but it happens when you don&#8217;t plan for worst case scenario)</p>
