      <p>This is a great idea! I have severe hearing loss, and that led to losing the ability to hear higher frequencies. I thought my trusty audible continuity meter had broken, in fact. Haptic feedback would be a great thing!</p>

      <p>This reminds me of the various &#8220;fun shield&#8221; / &#8220;stem shield&#8221; sort of things for the Arduino ecosystem. Skip the jumper wires for now, just play with code and libraries and stuff. Good stuff! And the slides and lesson content really round it out, I&#8217;m gonna point some newbies at this tomorrow.</p>

      <p>So it&#8217;s controlled manually by a remote control?  That&#8217;s not quite as cool as I had hoped.  It just seems cooler if the device shoots at anyone it sees (and has a good chance of hitting them), which would change the dynamics of a paintball match considerably.</p>

      <p>I know for a fact they have commerical products that can do this. All you need is a compatiable RC controller and a standerd cable for your remote. Look on the back of most professional remotes, there is something that can be plugged in to be used with a free program called FMS.</p>
