      <p>In the mid-80&#8217;s I worked at the calibration lab at a Texas Instruments semiconductor manufacturing facility.  One of the highly accurate instruments we had was a Leybold Heraeus spinning ball viscometer.  This measured air (vacuum) pressure by suspending a metal ball in a magnetic field, spinning to a carefully measured RPM, then allowing it to coast.  The rate at which the ball&#8217;s spin slowed was proportional to the gas pressure surrounding the ball.  This &#8220;toy&#8221; could serve the same function.  And, since it&#8217;s magnetically suspended, it would also work in a sealed container of liquid.</p>

      <p>I have a few of these and the L versions are indeed much more stable if you can find them but one thing to note here is that if you are been such a volt nut the REF is rarely bang on 2.5/5/7.5/10 so you should measure the reference initially (preferably at a given known temp!) and use that to mark up what the reference is,e.g 9.99425 blah Volts rather than just the boiler plate 10V that way you get the accuracy of the Ref rather than just some assumption.</p>

      <p>It would be great to see a construction which uses several mechanical gatesin order to do something meaningful at the end (counting?/adding?). But there is this friction problem. That could probably only be solved by separate power and data inputs. I wonder how that would look like, implemented mechanically?</p>

      <p>A few years back I built a small still projector made from a high intensity LED flashlight element, a cheap digital picture key chain and one of those business card sized Fresnel magnifiers from the drug store. This worked as a primitive art projector and lettering guide and It cost less than $15!</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve seen a similiar board to that shown at 1:51 &#8211; it&#8217;s a high security board, that sits between the motherboard and the back of the case. It is multi layer, and tracks all over the place. The chip on the back is probably a battery-backed (read:internal lithium battery not on the PCB) SRAM that contains the encryption codes etc. Removing the board WILL erase chip contents. Drilling trough the board to access motherboard is not an option either. I wonder, some years ago, it came out that you could do a password attack by sleeping a computer, freezing the ram with freeze spray, remove RAM and move to attack computer and read out password from RAM, still keeping data because it&#8217;s cold &#8211; it would be interesting to see if this could be done on the security chip.</p>
