      <p>Eye tracking is trivial (all you need is IR and you have nice black area to detect) and it&#8217;s only small part of the job. I&#8217;ve developed this kind of tracking and have used Tobii eye tracking. Both are great if you really really need to use them (disabled) but eye tracking in general is a bad idea; eyes are not meant to be used for pointing things and they get really tired fast. I&#8217;ve experienced it on my own eyes :)</p>
