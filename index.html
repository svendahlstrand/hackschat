      <p>A variant on early keyboard design, with the E-F pair. Good start. Look for a junk-able organ. Wurlitzer 25&#8217;s have reed switches on the pedal assembly that is removable. Pedal spacing is such that the pedals look like the same spacing as the lower keys as seen from normal seated position.</p>

      <p>This just seems about a thousand times more complicated than it should be. Honestly, wouldn&#8217;t it be much simpler to have a switch installed behind the button installed to complete the connection (button press) activated by a wireless controller? All the coding and bread board stuff he did seems like a waste of time.</p>
