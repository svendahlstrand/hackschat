      <p>How many people would even notice the difference between programming a Cortex M3 vs. a Cortex M0+ vs. an AVR vs. an MSP430?  You&#8217;ll notice differences in code size and execution speed, sure.  But unless you&#8217;re writing Assembly, all the difficulty in programming a microcontroller lies in manipulating the peripherals, and those aren&#8217;t determined by the core architecture.</p>

      <p>The transducer that they use is tiny, but far from simple.  To give you an idea, a product I make (laser gyroscopes for the military) uses a single channel linbo3 modulator, and it costs us about $300 a piece to make them&#8230;  The process is actually very similar to making IC&#8217;s only instead of growing on silicon we use the niobate substrait.</p>
