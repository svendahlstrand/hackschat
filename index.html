      <p>Both Android and iOS have TTS engines, so why not make software that creates all the buttons directly on the smartphone/tablet? It&#8217;s simple: just add new button, select icon, type text, and whenever button is pressed, TTS service is called. Using PowerPoint and then some external server is rather bizarre way to do custom UI, and it will make software useless, when server ever goes down. And, as Internet of Broken Things shows us, it will eventually go down&#8230;</p>

      <p>Did something similar on a tower i modified before.  It was an old IBM that had a broken plastic button for the power.  Decided to bondo over it and install a reed-relay.  Any time i wanted to turn it on, i just waved a magnet in the bottom corner(far far away from any components) and voila almost like magic.  To turn it off i just hovered it longer than usual.</p>

      <p>I was thinking this might make for an interesting site dashboard but based on price I&#8217;m better of using a cheap android tablet. The power use will be greater and the resolution lower but I get the secondary benefit of a touch screen and of course a color illuminated display.</p>
