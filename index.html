      <p>I can&#8217;t wait until it goes widespread and the price gets stable, honestly. It&#8217;s going to be the best thing to build a wrist-wearable computer upon, and I hope after half a year I&#8217;ll be able to actually get one to play with ;-) I just hope the software support will be as marvellous as with the previous versions.</p>

      <p>Richard should consider using an 18F series PIC with USB. Not only are they better chips overall, but you can throw away the expensive FTDI chip and end up with a single chip USB solution. Microchip has CDC firmware available you can use as-is.</p>
