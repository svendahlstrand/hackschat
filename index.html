      <p>The CPU was based on the AM2900 bit-slice chips, like most other CPUs of that day. DEC, Data General, HP, Tektronix, ATT, Feranti, Atari arcade machine. I wrote microcode for the Pixar Image Computer, which had four AM2900 chips for each of red, green, blue, and alpha. The microprocessor SIMD graphics instruction sets like Intel SSE descend from that architecture.</p>
