      <p>I have replaced many old can type dried out electrolytics by opening the can at the bottom joint and replacing the innards with a modern electrolytic cap of the right value. Modern caps are a lot smaller than the old time ones, and they I put it together and solder the seam with aluminum solder. It looks a lot better than having new caps dangling underneath. It is often hard to find high voltage caps, so you may have to hunt. Standard Radio in Long Island NY has a lot, but they are costly.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m really curious to see the quality of the flash fill lighting. Wouldn&#8217;t you know it, as soon as I drop $500 on a D50 body I start thinking about dropping more on remote flashes and all that jazz. Maybe this way I can save myself some money and kill some time between paychecks before I go buying an SB-600.</p>
