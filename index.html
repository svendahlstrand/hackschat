      <p>The way they measure the water in a municipal water tower is by measuring the water pressure with an analog pressure meter connected to the pipe that runs to the tank. The meter has a mechanical switch with an adjustable setpoint which turns on /off the fill pump motor. The meter is set below the base of the water tank, but typically is mounted at eye level in the pump room.</p>

      <p>The BMD-300 and the even smaller BMD-350 (both nrf52) require 5mA for continuous receiving AND continuous sending. They support BLE, the NRF24 protocol and NFC. The BMD-300 costs 11.70USD at digikey (single quantity; down to 7USD for larger quantities). There is a basic Micropython port for the nrf52. The Micropython port for the nrf51 (in large parts compatible to the nrf52) is developed and improved due to the Micro:bit. The nrf51 port supports NRF24 protocol.</p>
