      <p>Hmm so the co exploited a design issue to effectively cheat the consumer out of $ to performance ratio. Reminds me of the oldie saying about a half penny worth of tar, not immediately relevant but, touches on issue of forethought and it&#8217;s consequences betraying intelligence, conscientious and intent&#8230;</p>

      <p>This might work in space but then the dunk tank won&#8217;t. Most plants like our 1G in the same direction 24&#215;7, roots down etc. The Ferris wheel is a good analogy as the passengers want to remain upright. This is like one of those wheels that start horizontal  then goes to vertical. Huey, belch! Unfortunately this method messes with the central light idea. Then again the lights miss a light of space (and hence are dimmer) between each tray till things get bushy. Remember the inverse square law here. Spraying the roots is a third way that is popular in the covert crowd. Just raise the lights as things grow, constant lux.</p>

      <p>I am curious why the impedance change is such a setback for programming the device. The only thing I can imagine is it causes the data lines to draw too much current for the programmer to supply. If this is the case, a few unity-gain buffers (using op-amps or a using &#8220;flipped voltage follower&#8221; for brownie points) in series with the data lines will likely fix the problem.</p>

      <p>Well, if you decide to acquire cheap surplus commercial or military equipment that may be &#8220;near&#8221; your desired band of operation&#8230; You may pen your crystals to get the desired frequency.  One such application is for &#8220;Ham&#8221; or Amateur Radio operators, whose allocation spectrum space often butts right up to commercial space, to use this technique.</p>

      <p>With this method assuming you had a decent teather system you could use a little more expensive camera than with a kite. Although i still would not stick a $500 digital camera on that thing. It would be cool to see one of these built with a weather baloon and a stabilizing platform for the camera.</p>
