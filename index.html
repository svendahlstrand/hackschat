      <p>I had to cut at the hum from the desk lamp. This could be interesting (with marble) if the 24 sensors had been set out in a cycle of fifths or anything (round) other the conventional key layout. Or get 24 lasers or pin spots and line em up for an air harp. The playing at the beginning is fouled up, it&#8217;s unplayable as is.</p>

      <p>That&#8217;s interesting. At first glance I thought the sattelite lock would have been lost due to the speed reached, as some modules are programmed to stop providing accurate data past certain altitudes/speeds so that commercial gps unit&#8217;s can&#8217;t be used for guided missile platforms.</p>

      <p>Nice, and even timely for me.  I am looking at wireless controllers and USB adapters so I can get 4 controllers hooked up to a MythTV system I&#8217;ve built.  There are tons of PS2 wireless controllers and even PS2-USB adapters.  I figure I could one built up for under CAD$30, possibly much cheaper if I can find deals.</p>
