      <p>I have a Circuit Celler issue, (Wasn&#8217;t that what it was called? Can&#8217;t find it, but I know it&#8217;s floating around here somewhere.) bought from- Circuit City? I don&#8217;t know it was years ago, but it had an article about a firefighting robot contest. I don&#8217;t think any of them were 3D printed, or laser-cut. No Arduinos. I think there were Basic stamps, but I&#8217;m not sure.. Times have changed.</p>

      <p>Sailplane pilots use huge versions of these to snatch gliders into the air.  This is especially common in Europe where fuel is expensive.  The basic principle is much like running with a kite.  With a few thousand feet of open space to pull the cable out over, they can get altitudes of over 1000 feet.  It&#8217;s quite an experience; the ground roll is maybe a hundred feet, and most of the climb is done at about a 45 degree angle!  This photo will give you a bit of an idea what it looks like; the winch is out of sight over the rise in the background.</p>
