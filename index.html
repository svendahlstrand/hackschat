      <p>How do 6 diodes in series give him a total voltage drop of 1V? Also, if you&#8217;re using a LM317 anyway, why no use it as a current regulator, if you are interested in a constant current? In constant current mode, the minimum voltage of 1.25V drops across the current sense resistor, so you wouldn&#8217;t need those diodes either.</p>

      <p>Huh, neat! Obvious next step is putting that all on the same PCB. It would be very, very cool to get a phone on the market that could be easily hardware-modified. I did some work on an old iPhone 4s, just small things like antenna modification/better lights.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve used a lot of the same companies she lists.  I am not associated with this company (just a happy customer) but I also use Accutrace (pcb4u.com) for a lot of protos (and some production).  They have a $10 each 2-sided proto special for up to 20 sq inches that gets you very high quality boards in a week.  They also usually run a 2nd order on the house special which can bring your price for protos down to $5/each or you can apply it to a 2nd production run.  Depending on the size of your board this is a much better deal than a lot of the well known services.</p>

      <p>Nice work reversing that CRC. It might be interesting to try the reverse hack &#8211; build/repurpose a transmitter to send arbitrary temp readings to the base station. You could use it to, say, monitor the temps of a distant server room, or temperature readings for some other part of the world (sourced from the Web, of course).</p>
