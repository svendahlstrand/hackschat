      <p>The smallest discrete component I&#8217;ve worked with while hand soldering would be a 0201 resistor while the smallest pitch would be a 0.4mm DFN. Components that have a line of pins are dealt with by tacking one or two sides to the PCB and then drag soldering the rest with a big tip. Component size/pin pitch is practically irrelevant when the option to reflow is available.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve got no experience with 3d printing (for now), but isn&#8217;t that what the heated build platforms are intended to help combat?  This is by no means a troll.  I understand that heated platforms raise the monetary barrier to entry of a 3d printer, and I appreciate this guy&#8217;s ingenuity in coming up with a hack to solve his problem.  Just wondering is all.</p>
