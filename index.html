      <p>Be sure to wear gloves and a organics rated respirator when working with uncured resins. Its pretty common for people to suddenly develop a hypersensitivity to the stuff. A lot of people don&#8217;t know about this. A friend of mine became sensitive to it literally overnight and she developed rashes any time she was even near uncured resin. Once it is cured it is fine. </p>
