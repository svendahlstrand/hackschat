      <p>It&#8217;s not hard to control a (SIPO) latched shift register with just one line and some careful timing, a short drop of the line causes 1 to be entered, a medium drop of the line causes a 0 to be entered and a long drop of the line causes the data to latch (and a zero to be entered).  Disadvantage is that you do lose 1 bit (the last bit is always zero).</p>

The only thing I thought of right off for this project is: Why not mount a mirror opposite the laser, and keep the optical sensor in the package with the keypad?</p>

      <p>So&#8230; I&#8217;m not really experienced with this much (or at all really) but could someone rig this up to read a 3d form and then auto feed that to one of those diy cnc machines? To create a &#8220;copy machine&#8221; for 3d objects? Or possibly just to get a starting point for a CAD project (which you could modify from an existing 3d object for later CNCing? Or am I missing the point of these little things?</p>
