      <p>If you ever find yourself in a similar situation ‚Äî with a radio-synchronized clock unable to find a transmission ‚Äî there is a mobile app that somehow simulates these radio transmissions using your phone‚Äôs audio speaker. I didn‚Äôt think it would be possible until I saw it work with my own eyes. The name is ‚ÄúClock Wave‚Äù. I have it for iOS. Not sure if an Android version exists.</p>

      <p>Thanks for this. My father designed time-shared OS&#8217;s for GE (GECOS) and IBM (CALL/360, a stop-gap for OS/360). He was part of an OS team that formed at GE and split off in 1967 when GE Computers dissolved. One of them hit it big later, I think with Netware (one of the first network sw companies).</p>

      <p>Pretty amazing. I&#8217;d worry a bit about O3 buildup &#8211; ion generators like that usually have a MnO2 catalyst that back-converts the O3 to O2 with about 80% efficiency. Ozone has a tendency to eat up rubber seals and things.</p>
