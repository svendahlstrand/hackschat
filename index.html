      <p>Definitely like it, although I think I;&#8217;d go with red. Looks better (imo) and better for your night vision. When you want to give your car a more custom look doing a mod like this is a great alternative to replacing the whole assembly and usually losing your cars actual mileage.</p>

      <p>Great hack! I had wanted to build something similar, basically a parallel to serial EEPROM adapter. Using some 7400 or 4000 series shift registers I could reasonably approximate a simplified I2C bus, and get to reuse all the old EPROM and EEPROM chips I have. The goal was originally intended for a Basic Stamp, but could work with a PIC or a standard serial port with a little more work. If anybody knows how to do the whole I2C bus approximation in discrete logic easily, please post. Implementing the automatic address shift, rollover, and controll registers seems pretty hard without a micro of some sort.</p>
