      <p>i&#8217;ve also had alot of success with freezing the hard drive.  take care not to let ice crystals form on it (&#8230;or inside it).  it usually has a reduced read speed and it eventually stops working again, but freezing the drive gives you plenty of time to get the data off, or even boot from it if thats what gets you happy.  i&#8217;ve tried this three times with success each time.</p>
