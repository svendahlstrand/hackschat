      <p>Not so novel though&#8230; I&#8217;ve done the same for my daughter who has balance problems and who needs to see where she&#8217;s stepping at night. I also have a similar setup in the kitchen for LED strips under the cabinets. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the only one who&#8217;s done so either.</p>

      <p>Nice writeup. I&#8217;ve been playing around with homemade 8&#215;8 matrices for the past few days using a MAX7219. It takes care of the multiplexing for me, and all of the current limiting is done with just one resistor over the chip.</p>
