      <p>Great project. Though for maximum safety a set of optocoupler could be of added in the serial line. I love the fact that the Arduino acts as a multipurpose io-co-processor. Fun project.</p>

      <p>I wonder if 15K hard drive platters would be balanced and stable enough for the higher rotational speeds required by this device&#8230;and if they would have too much mass.  (Purely speculative&#8230;I didn&#8217;t look at any of Tesla&#8217;s original design theory).</p>

      <p>Nice, but why is it so slow? I&#8217;ve tried Raspberry Pi with VICE once and it runs in native C64 speed. I don&#8217;t know if it is a good idea to use a discontinued emulator, at least </p>

      <p>My only beef with this is the UPS will charge the batteries rather slowly, as their AH capacity is MUCH higher than the original batteries.  You might be able to adjust the charge rate in software or tweak the unit itself.  </p>
