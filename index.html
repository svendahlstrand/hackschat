      <p>None of these &#8220;learn microcontroller&#8221; kits/boards seem to offer much in the way of wrong polarity protection, over current to pin protection, etc. Isn&#8217;t that exactly the type of things lay or learning operators are likely to accidentally do and fry pins or boards?</p>

      <p>so&#8230;whats the point to a driving simulator?  i see the point to flight simulators because very few people can afford to purchase a plane.  i feel like most people have been in a car before, and people with a drivers license have driven before&#8230;i just dont understand it&#8230;its not like their car is so special that it requires their own simulator, its a cheap mercedes.</p>
