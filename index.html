      <p>Thanks for the writeup!  The internals are currently just a bunch of jumper wires&#8230; there is nothing worth showing!  I may eventually make a PCB for it, but this works well enough for the time being.</p>

      <p>It looks like it might be kind of wobbly, zip ties and all, why not just design a variety of connectors that can fit inside and/or outside round and square tubing. A fixed 90 degree connector could be less wobbly than two pyramids zip tied together (I think).</p>
