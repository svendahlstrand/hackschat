      <p>It&#8217;s important to note that you should match the 75Œ© impedance of the coax with the 50Œ© impedance that your radio expects. It&#8217;s not mentioned here, but in the Reddit thread says it&#8217;s done with an inductor and a capacitor. Since a dipole antenna has a real impedance of about 75Œ©, the balun is not doing any real matching here.</p>

      <p>I notice they are looking at implementing a &#8220;virtual fence&#8221;, where the flight controller module checks the GPS of the craft to see if they are going to fly into restricted zones or above ceiling heights and either changes course or shuts downs the aircraft.  So you would need to have a GPS compliant device with an ability to connect to a wireless network for &#8220;real-time&#8221; flight restrictions for &#8220;fencing&#8221;.  I&#8217;m guessing a registration or license would be needed to allow access to the FAA node that would handle that, at a charge of course.  You would also need to implement the software in an &#8220;open standard&#8221; &#8211; I mean Government open standard of course &#8211; so, I&#8217;m pretty sure that software won&#8217;t work.</p>

      <p>I wish this part had been covered more in the TV episode. It was barely mentioned, and flicked in front of the screen a few times. Possibly because I suspect the development and production of this board was outside the 10-day window. :)</p>
