      <p>How about a high tech piggy bank for the kids? Allowances are issued electronically and each kid in the family has an ATM card for withdrawals. Pay them interest and offer a higher rate if they play 15 minutes of math games on the screen. The ATM also acts as a chore scheduler and &#8216;time clock&#8217; to keep track of completed tasks. Heck, even offer credit with educational game scores determining the interest rate. It would be educational on many levels.</p>
