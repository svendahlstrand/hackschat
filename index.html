      <p>At first i thought it may be a hoax, but i think it makes sense. It seems to do the same thing as a photo flash circuit; you have a capacitor charged to 330V with enough current for a flash, but not enough voltage for an arc, a separate circuit starts the arc, which causes the current to be dumped making the bright flash. I think the same thing happens here, 240V isn&#8217;t enough for an arc at the distances found in appliances and plugs&#8230; until the stun gun makes an arc acting as a bridge causing the short. Dangerous, but impressive.</p>

      <p>I actually just did this a few weeks ago. Got DSL working on a 1998 pentium 2 233mhz with 32 megs of ram. It originally ran windows 95b, which means it had fat32 support for drives larger than 2gb, which made it odd that it had a 2gb partition and an empty but fat32 formatted 1gb partition. Oh well, now that partition lets me dual boot DSL and win95b. I can now use usb flash drives to exchange files. Just turned my beloved boat anchor into a surprisingly functional machine</p>
