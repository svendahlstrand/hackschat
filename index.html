      <p>Not clear if separate power control of both up and down. Color temp should be adjustable. Hotter (blue) up is good with warmer down. Simple way would be this. Choice of color temp-time-of-day and reference to natural skylight (up) which is blue.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m loving the fallout pitena of the built. age has done well for it in at least astetics. its like what you expect an eleivator face plate to be in close to 50-100 years. on the opposite side of the coin very interesting build with the psudo anolog led component. would be very FFVII by now if he used some vixe tubes =P</p>
