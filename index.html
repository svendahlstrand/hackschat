      <p>Hmm, nice idea for next camping trip. Put balloon over hot water electrolysis, fill balloon with H2 and O2, release then fire with lasers, best done at night of course. This posting along with recent posting on green lasers and their dangers makes for interesting musing for next camping trips, thanks :-)</p>

      <p>Q-Switching is a process where the internal beam path of the laser is interrupted causing the laser crystal (Nd:YVO4) to store the energy and then release it in one big pulse. Kind of like putting your finger over a garden hose. When you let go you get a more intense pulse for a short period.</p>
