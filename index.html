      <p>Why does a several thousand dollar medical device NOT come with basic voltage protection circuitry? Poly resettable fuses, AC voltage limiters, a quality AC/DC converter, etc? One would think the FIRST thing the machine should do is filter the inputs being sent to it and the only real input from the mains is going to be expected to be no more than 120/240 volts, depending on the country you are living in.</p>
