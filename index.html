      <p>The TV programme mentions nothing about if the owner has CHECKED that the car is indeed locked. I would guess the thieves have a jammer, preventing the owner to lock the car, as most people just lock it with their backs turned at the car, and they don&#8217;t check if the car locks&#8230; That would allow the thieves to open the car and get the items.</p>
