      <p>I think calling this a &#8220;Stand-alone Live VU meter&#8221; is to take it a bit too far.   It&#8217;s actually just a remote display unit for winamp, it doesn&#8217;t do any metering itself.   Would a microcontroller, connected by USB to the PC, driving a LED strip also be at &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; unit?</p>

      <p>I will admit that I didn&#8217;t read the entire writeup, (I can&#8217;t stand it when people frame documents inside another page&#8230;) but it looks like the majority of the project was to determine the beam profile of the laser, which can be done with a CCD (no lens, just a bare ccd) and a suficient attenuator&#8230;  An old security cam (that you can manually set the exposure time on) and capture card with a few layers of neutral density filters should get you plenty of info about the beam quality&#8230;</p>

      <p>When i first came across Greg&#8217;s page about 3 years ago i became interested in coiling.  Want an easy proof of concept?  I built a small 1-stage coilgun using a disposable flash camera and photoflash caps scavenged from other cameras.  It would actually launch a small nail about 100 feet using a bank of about 10 caps.</p>
