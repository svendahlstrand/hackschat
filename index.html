      <p>These project confuse me. These problems were solved years ago in the open source community with project such as APM and PX4 and today there are toy drones that you can buy on the shelves of Wal-mart do all of this, to say nothing of countless cheap autopilots you can buy on Amazon. What is the point of doing it again from scratch, badly? Why not focus on problems that haven&#8217;t be solved countless times before?</p>

      <p>I restored an SX-64 last summer, replaced VIC and some 74xx logic on clock daughterboard plus some 3D printing for those keyboard clips. the dual drive mod is cool, but an sd card reader on device 9 is a little more practical. has anyone tried the 1541 ultimate on the SX? I assume it&#8217;ll work but they are a little expensive.</p>

      <p>Very nice, judging from the watch either a European hacker or a ham. Also this clock is begging to be made into a watch, I just don&#8217;t know how fragile the tube would be in a watch configuration and he&#8217;ed have to change the time display to only come on at the press of a button to save the battery. Great work.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s not just a protocol thing; my understanding (which I&#8217;ve gleaned from the people who are trying to make boards that support the new consoles out of the box, and having trouble) is that Sony went with Microsoft&#8217;s strategy this year in that to appear as a &#8220;proper PS4 controller&#8221; (as I understand it, PS3 controllers apparently *can* be supported on a per-software-basis, but most devs aren&#8217;t doing it; that would allow pretty much generic HID device profile with the special header to enable button 17 Home support or whatever) of using chip-based security platform to ensure licensing on the controllers front. It sucks, because the PS3 was *seriously* nice for tinkerers due to the HID support.</p>
