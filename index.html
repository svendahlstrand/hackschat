      <p>I&#8217;ve actually put some real footage through the system now (although it was taken from a panning tripod rather than a UAV) and the image at the top of this post actually shows the results of that. There are some issues at the moment. Errors in tracking tend to cause a kind of anaglyph effect in images, and the system can&#8217;t process footage with rotations in it but I&#8217;m hoping to come up with solutions to these problems in the next few weeks.</p>
