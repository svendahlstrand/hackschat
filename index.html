      <p>You can do a modification of this where there is a sheet of Plexiglas attached to the pantograph and it just has a small dot on it. This lets you look at the scene without the wooded parts actually travelling over it. The motion is the same, it is just offset.</p>

      <p>Cool. I wonder how difficult it would be to scrap the RFID system and work with a wi-fi hotspot using WPA2 that unlocks when authenticated with the MAC address of your phone. Would it be more or less secure? You could fake the MAC but you&#8217;d need the encryption key first.</p>

      <p>That has to be one of the most interesting things I have seen in a while.  I love it when people take a &#8220;step back&#8221; and implement things in hardware, instead of using microcontrollers or some form of computer.</p>
