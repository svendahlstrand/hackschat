      <p>Ah ha, good post. All sorts of issues with switch mode inverters. I designed the &#8220;Mypower-200&#8221; automotive unit circa 1990. ie cig lighter plug to basic modified sine offering 200w surge mode around 150w sustained for 50Hz output peak volts on cycle 330v with ideal 12v input connections. Sold just over 4000 of them mostly Australia through Solartronics Australia head office Perth Western Australia. Did our own extrusion assembled  in Perth. Key issue for DC to DC stage was &#8216;gentle&#8217; gate drive to mosfets (slow turn on/off) from a lucky find being a CMOS bistable chip easy to control deadtime. Ran at about 60KHz or so. Lot of attention to the transformer, our first big Chinese purchase. The core and winding took a couple of iterations, 3 turn wide foil primary push pull. Manufacturer did the right thing with consistent production quality. We tested it for 250w and got about 96%  efficiency 20C in first 10 secs operation at 150w then drooped to 92% or so. Few customers overloaded the things, tech repairs let us down with negligible attention to static control measures. Good experience, we used bootstrap mode on output bridge drive, MOVs and simple filter, might publish the circuit diagram, have to find it since I moved an A3 sheet plotted on my 7586B hp grit wheel vertical plotter&#8230;</p>
