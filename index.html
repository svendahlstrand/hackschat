      <p>Thank you &#8211; I have often thought that satnav must contain some very interesting (and difficult) software: first calculate your position from the received satellite info, then draw a map on the screen with road info, and then best route calculation. The second link in the article is a good overview of what is involved in the first of those steps, and I&#8217;m glad I did not have to work out how to do it!</p>

      <p>I LOL&#8217;d at the &#8220;next step&#8221;:  Putting the sensor on a cat along with a buzzer to establish a &#8220;fence&#8221; so that if the cat jumps on the counter, the buzzer goes off.  &#8220;Only problem is I haven&#8217;t got a cat, but that&#8217;s a problem that is easily solved.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Not to disparage his efforts, but this is not unique.  There is a nationwide competition for high school student to build ROV&#8217;s with the same technologies (PVC and bilge pumps).  A great experience, these students come up with very workable craft.  They have to prove it in a series of competitions, completing tasks seeing only though the camera eyes of their ROV&#8217;s.</p>
