      <p>After all, nowadays you can stand in the bathroom like an idiot unable to make the water come out of the faucet and the soap to come out of the dispenser to wash your hands.  Then you can get to walk out without dry hands because of the whizzy paper-towel dispenser or hot-air dryer which isn&#8217;t working.  Why NOT extend this glorious future to the other plumbing!  Instead of having toilets which you can&#8217;t flush, we could maybe have toilets which you can&#8217;t even open the lid on!  Wouldn&#8217;t that be fun!  Or butt-washers which refuse to stop washing!  [True story from when they installed Japanese toilets at work.]</p>
