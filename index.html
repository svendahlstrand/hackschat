      <p>I&#8217;d guess that a large part of the power usage is for the lamp, which could be changing what is being measured. It might be an idea to use a GPIO pin on the RPi with a SSR to turn the light on 1-5 seconds before the image is taken and off 1-2 second after the image is taken. So that the lighting for the measurement has minimal effect on the yeast for the remainder of the 300 seconds between each image. It also means that you could use a slightly more powerful light source for sharper images. </p>

      <p>The Applle IIe has a very nice sculpted keyboard, meaning the key surfaces as a whole form a concave keyboard which helps keep all the keys within a radius of the finders. Very low fatique, like an IBM Selectric typewriter. The Platinum edition has a numeric keypad as well. They are dirt cheap and plenty of room inside plus mount an LCD on top. hey, I&#8217;ll have to try it!</p>
