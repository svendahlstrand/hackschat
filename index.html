      <p>Unless they have released a video after the one linked in the article (they haven&#8217;t on youtube), they have not actually connected their debugger to the real AGC yet. What they have done is connected the debugger to a FPGA pretending to be the AGC, and that is what is shown in the video.  </p>

      <p>It&#8217;s a nice project to be sure, but I expected a much better audio quality. Back in the nineties, I used an Amiga 500 with an 8 bit sampler and a crappy microphone in a tape recorder and it was much cleaner. That on a lowly 7MHz 68000 processor :) The software was called Technosound turbo II released in 1993.</p>
