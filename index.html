      <p>Drop targets would be pretty easy. Make rectangular flags with a thinner bottom end. Put them up through slots in the playfield so they hook in place. Have rubber bands pull down and slightly toward the impact side. Some sort of vertical guides would be needed to keep the targets upright.</p>

      <p>I do this for work, so it would be a bit of a busman&#8217;s holiday for me, but I this is the right city to visit if you are *seriously* considering working with a contract manufacturer or Chinese suppliers. I highly recommend Huaqiangbei (even though Huaqiang road is super torn up with construction). If you have a few extra days, check out Wutong Mountain just east of the city, there are stairs up to the top (and vendors with beer).</p>

      <p>lol, yeah, the reason we&#8217;re still trying to wrap our head around it is because the guy reads a little too much Thomas Pynchon (or not enough, he&#8217;s a lot less coherent than the Pynchon i&#8217;ve read &#8211; which was good, btw).</p>
