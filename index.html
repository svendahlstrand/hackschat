      <p>From a quick glance at the web site it seems promising in that it doesn&#8217;t seem to pass all your data through a third party server. I haven&#8217;t read enough yet to determine whether your data stays private or not. I have been working for a while on cloud free IOT implementations and this may turn out to be a good way to go to prevent the rapacious vacuuming up of personal data. I hope so, and will check it out.</p>

      <p>Hjmm right up my alley circa mid 1990&#8217;s then again 2000 to 2005, thanks :-) Nice idea, if it can go through a comb and do higher pocsag accepted frequencies would be great as I have heaps of those pagers, though pocsag can work at lower just need to change the pager front end RF board. Most of the good Chinese pagers were dual board for that reason. Here&#8217;s the frequency spread and info on pocsag on this link </p>
