      <p>Thats freaking awesome! I made something like this when I was younger. I basically glued some small mirrors to two speakers then pointed a laser that bounced off of both of them then played music through the speakers. It produced a cool effect where the laser moved with the music, often making perfect circles when there was constant bass.</p>
