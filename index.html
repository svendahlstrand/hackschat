      <p>&#8221; Researchers in Austria, Germany, and Australia recently published a paper that shows that noise can actually improve the flow of energy. While the paper is behind a paywall, the Focus article is available and, of course, you can probably find a copy of the paper if you want to read the entire thing.&#8221;</p>

      <p>According to wiki the &#8220;human genome has approximately 3.3 billion base-pairs&#8221;. If these are the same as the mentioned segments here, and if we know that the human dna contains plenty of redundant information, it would be more practical to create an information-virus, and let it replicate. Then we could all have all the information as long as mankind last.</p>

      <p>Why would you want to install OSX on a computer that comes with WinXP, the best windows OS to ever come out.  I can understand if it came with vista, but hell, Mac can&#8217;t possibly have that much going for it to make you want to install OSX on it, unless of course all your other computers are Macs as well, to which I say, WTF?  I may not agree with Microsoft&#8217;s Ethics, but their product is more supported, so I don&#8217;t have much of a choice.</p>

      <p>Lame, HackADay ain&#8217;t what it used to be. Before they&#8217;d publish hacks that an average guy could do with just a minimal understanding of electronics, and some extra stuff as well for guys who were far more advanced. That was great, and half of the hacks were fun things like how to get around this or that. Now its just all stupid stuff like mousepad coolers and technical reports on LED&#8217;s with no actual hack.</p>
