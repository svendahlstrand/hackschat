      <p>I was looking at the battery charger circuit and I saw it had a 7805 which if my memory services right, is a linear voltage regulator.  I avoid those now, because they are typically very inefficient.  Could one use a switching regulator, like the ones max makes.  They seem to an awesome job, and i have tons of them sitting around in my room.  You can get tons of them for free if you are like that (which I am).</p>
