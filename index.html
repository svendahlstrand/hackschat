      <p>I don&#8217;t know if I could have shown such restraint. Having had to use slack in the past and hating every single second of it, I truly can say I can not stand slack or any similar paradigms and I wish them all to burn to ashes because I believe that on a whole these are solutions in search of a problem that does not exist and they actually make work and communication more difficult, obfuscated and less effective.</p>
