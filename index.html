      <p>I think it&#8217;s a really awesome job, very nice work. I would have gone a step further and turned the top drawer into a combination cellphone charger and media player. I&#8217;d install a power strip with 12v and 5v out, put in a small class D amplifier connected to the volume control, and a pair of small full range speakers somewhere on the back or sides. That way I could charge my phone while using it to play music in my workshop or wherever I take the toolbox to work. </p>

      <p>Most heavy duty record cleaners comparable to this go for anywhere from 200-500 bucks a pop or even more + the cleaner.  Some record cleaners have more warnings then most household chemicals.  I wonder if there&#8217;s a cheap way to make a brush comparable to a VPI brush.  Awesome hack though.</p>
