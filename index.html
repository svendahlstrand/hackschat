      <p>As a lover of CHDK, I&#8217;ll totally be looking into this. I&#8217;ve been wanting to use it to do long term time lapses (weeks/months possibly) from remote locations. I&#8217;ve been looking at the Pi camera too but the Canons are far superior of course. Oh, the amount of fun you can have with a $50 used camera!</p>
