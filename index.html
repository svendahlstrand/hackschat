      <p>this is interesting but the first thing i noticed was that there are flood lamps housed in what looks like a cardboard box. then there is huge disclaimer about the dangers of ac electricity, but the circuit itself is not in a proper grounded case. finally it says &#8220;Dimming the lights cannot be done via PWM as LEDs are. The lamps must be phase controlled.&#8221; Phase control is a type of PWM, so they actually are dimmed via PWM.</p>
