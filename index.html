      <p>Given that the microscope seems set up to allow for bottom lighting I would not describe it as a metallurgical scope (though it can certainly be used for that) but more generally as a trinocular stereo microscope. (trinocular means it has the third tube in the center for a camera or fixed single oculair lens. It seems to be set up for through lens lighting, also not a feature I&#8217;ve seen much for metallurgy. They tend to use external (ring) lights in my experience as through lens lighting can cause glare on metal parts.</p>
