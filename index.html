      <p>You have to be wrong about this, it doesn&#8217;t look like it supports 360.  There&#8217;s an authentication chip that it looks for before it will talk to a controller.  The Chinese have cloned it (such as in the Paewang Revolution PCB and knockoff wired 360 controllers) for what it&#8217;s worth.</p>

      <p>I built one in welding shop in high school for use in the small engines class, but it wasn&#8217;t microcontroller&#8217;ed or anything.  I forget which all parts I used, but they were old 80&#8217;s buick parts.  I think like a power steering pump or something, but that doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>
