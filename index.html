      <p>Brian, I understand that you must make a living by editing 2-3 articles a day _no matter the cost_ like a battery hen, but supposing your readers have such a short attention span and less than 6 months buffered memory is slightly disturbing, if not disrespectful.</p>

      <p>Might have to build something like it to replace my ghetto zip lock container solution I got going on. No idea what Aaron does in the shower (nor am I sure I want to know). Once I get that water temperature set just right, it feels like all my stress and worries are being washed away, I get carried away by that and just stand there. That and some of the best ideas I&#8217;ve ever had were while I was in the shower.</p>

      <p>Don&#8217;t fret over not having a laser cutter. They are not that impressive. The burns, the rough edges; what they do well is straight lines. Google up some woodworking techniques to calibrate whatever you have be it a tablesaw, bandsaw etc.. and you can get results that only very expensive laser cutters can produce. The parts will even have a better surface finish should you use quality blades and jigs. </p>
