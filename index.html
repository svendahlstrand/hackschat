Most of the ancient 8-bit computers made their address and data buses available for hacking, making it a trivial matter to add I/O ports, and their BASIC interpreters had &#8220;peek&#8221; and &#8220;poke&#8221; instructions that made the software side equally trivial.  How are &#8220;modern&#8221; GPIOs easier?</p>
