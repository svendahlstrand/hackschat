      <p>Nice project and interesting as well. I was just wondering if you can use it for unlocking your computer, for example, only when you are staring into the camera? Would you recommend it for something like this? Also what about the privacy? Should I keep the camera facing a wall?</p>

      <p>Dangit, you just made me miss Google PowerMonitor(RIP Sep 2011).   Monitoring your household energy consumption is smart and it really gives you a good idea of where your power is going and when. There needs to be a better, permanent and free service out there to do this with a variety of hardware and an open API but I guess for that to evolve someone would need to monetize bulk power usage information by zip code or something.  Now if there was only a way I could get my power company to tell me what my KWH rate was, and notify me when it changes.</p>

      <p>A lot of problems with these is that they will not do a WIDE voltage swing.  I have a 15 watt solar panel that would generate useable power until dark if one ofthese chips was used for the low light part,  but when in full sunlight they pop like an ant under a magnifying glass.   I have a 250mv-9V swing on the flexible solar panel.   Yes I will not get 15 watts at 250mv but I am getting something that could be stored if the circuit could step it up.</p>
