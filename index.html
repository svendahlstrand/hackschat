      <p>Nice! I was thinking about making a mini arcade cabinet with a mega drive but decided against it after researching more into the psone LCD and finding how only a certain screen from a specific region would work with these machines, didn&#8217;t want to risk finding halfway through the build that the LCD I bought would never work (although I could be wrong about the whole region thing).</p>

      <p>That is a VERY old pacemaker; pacemaker technology changes drastically every 6 months, so everything they learned with that one is moot.  Those pacemakers used a wired magnetic transducer placed directly over the pacemaker for communication; the latest ones are wireless technology.  Anyway, who would want to hack a pacemaker?  The only worthwhile thing I can think to do with an old pacemaker is to use the titanium housing.</p>
