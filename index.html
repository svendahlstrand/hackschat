      <p>What you&#8217;d want in Australia, however, is a motion sensor by the door. Australia Post seem to have a habit of pre-filling out all the &#8220;we missed you&#8221; cards and just dropping them at your door&#8230; if you notice and run out, the postie usually acts like you&#8217;re inconveniencing them when you actually request that they give you the parcel now&#8230;</p>

      <p>I actually got to see a demo of this thing last June while I was at an engineering camp at Tech. It&#8217;s biggest limitation was that it couldn&#8217;t play anything that required slides especially well. But it could handle &#8220;Layla&#8221; fairly well (that was the only song that was played on it for us).</p>
