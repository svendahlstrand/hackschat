      <p>I remember when I was a children, in 1982 they let us try it at my primary school, and we had a lot a fun searching for homonyms (or stupid names) in the entire country, when we only had the local paper phonebooks before that, as it was initially meant at replacing the electronically and leased at no cost (except telecommunications fees) to phone subscribers.</p>

      <p>Tangentially on topic, but some great hackers in Spain are developing the IceZUM Alhambra, an open source FPGA development board based on Lattice iCE40HX1K-TQ144 (icestick), using the open source toolchain Icestorm. This board has been featured at HaD in the past, but I think it&#8217;s important to remember it again as it also provides a friendly form factor (Arduino-style) and lots of tutorials and projects are being developed by the community to help begginers getting into FPGAs.</p>

      <p>Nikon makes some lovely lenses but I have never really cared for their bodies. I have been thinking of getting an EF adapter to mount some of the old manual Nikkors I have on my Canon 5D, anybody know of a good quality one? They are all over eBay but I&#8217;d rather buy something a little more assuring then a cheaply milled aluminum ring from China with no guarantee it won&#8217;t get stuck on my lens or body.</p>
