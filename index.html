      <p>Looks sexy, but if kinda flys like a brick. They need some vertical stabs and turbines or simply props instead of edfs. I do think scaling it up will help, however. Also, since there are two edfs, they cound use the differential throttle and a gyro to increase yaw stability, cuz i noticed some wobble in that axis</p>
