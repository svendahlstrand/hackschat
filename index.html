      <p>Not having ever used Garry&#8217;s Mod I may be talking utter pants, but wouldn&#8217;t that be a good training prog for this.  Set up some awkward to film scenes and use this controller to set up the shots.  I am of course assuming you can do something like this using Garry&#8217;s mod.</p>

      <p>Instead of drilling two different holes in the coupler and still end up with a rigid coupling, he could have drilled the needed hole right into the lead screw. Attach with epoxy (after cleaning out the cutting oil) or with a regular grub-screw and hole. you need much less room for your steppers that way, which makes it easy to keep them inside the enclosure.</p>

      <p>Well, this kind of device is pretty much flat out illegal to operate anywhere in Europe. You aren&#8217;t too likely to get caught due to the low power. However all it takes is only one person who files a complaint about interference on their radio for a van with triangulation equipment to show up. </p>
