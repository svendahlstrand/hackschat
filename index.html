      <p>Good focus for a quick fix. If the drive from the initiating gate was able to handle the gate capacitance for the speed/duty cycle I&#8217;d have used a sot23 2N7002 or equivalent with a SMT resistor to act as inverter. Though I do have lots of ttl parts it&#8217;s what&#8217;s available that often counts first and it worked :-) Cheers.</p>

      <p>If these chip sizes were affordable in the 80&#8217;s! What we did was piggybacking another 2K on top to get 4K total and use a single inverter gate to switch the ENB pin between the chips with the higher address line. A 32K sram was 70$ from my local shack back then. Too much for teen! Also mentioned in the article; the 7805 linear voltage regulator was, and still is, a pig. It burned 900mA so you could only run a ZX81 2-3  hours on a string of D-cells. Having had a switchmode regulator would wave extended that to days, but none were available outside NASA then,</p>
