      <p>wow.. that&#8217;s awesome.  anyone have an idea how to record from the thing if you&#8217;re using a camera with an analogue output and don&#8217;t have the digital8 recorder?  i love modular design concepts like this, but for me it falls down at the requirement for a specific recorder, which if it was cheap on ebay before, probably won&#8217;t be now.</p>
