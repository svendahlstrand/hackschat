      <p>There are many functional 3D prototyper concepts, almost all better than this thing, yet this one gets all the press. Why? the &#8220;self-replicating&#8221; claim. It isn&#8217;t self-replicating, not even close. In fact, I have yet to see a RepRap that can duplicate ANY part usable to construct another RepRap at all. It certainly doesn&#8217;t turn out the bearings, bolts, linear rails, motion control circuits, stepping motors, or the other 95% of the needed hardware even &gt;IF&lt; it could turn out usable plastic structural members.</p>
