      <p>A diode, when reverse biased, will generate noise.  Some are better at it than others.  But so long as you get good noise, all should be well.  &#8220;Distinctiveness&#8221; would suggest a diode isn&#8217;t generating random noise.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Looks like the peaks are indeed greater than ¬±100 volt. This makes sense that more voltage is needed for more volume.  I think next will be to test a voltage multiplying circuit or driving the 4-pin device from the MSP.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Really clever idea to &#8220;outsource&#8221; the processing of your portable gaming like that.  Different service, but it would be interesting if bandwidth ever got to the point where you could just VPN into a remote console and &#8220;rent&#8221; it.  Maybe that already exists.</p>
