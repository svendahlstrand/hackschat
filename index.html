      <p>I&#8217;m impressed &#8211; I&#8217;ve never seen individual &#8220;fingers&#8221; of a single plate acrylic lit separately like that, and I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it if I hadn&#8217;t seen it.  I would have expected a lot more coupling from one finger to the next, but I guess the top edge is polished well enough that almost all of the reflection is straight back down to where it came from.  Very slick.</p>

      <p>Has anyone used a CNC router to create the front plate? In this case it would be easy to mill the characters (or only the critical characters like A) and leave 0.1 mm of wood. After the front plate is filled with epoxy, one just needs to sand down the back of the plate.</p>

      <p>Saw that RC vid I think via ./ and while it&#8217;s ultra cool possibly not much of a hack, more of a professional production with lots of experience, testing, planning, and involvement by the authorities so the DHS wouldn&#8217;t come down on him for it.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find some information on building a PCB spray etcher. Although transfers and board preparation are important i&#8217;ve found that that only way to get really sharp clean lines is to use a spray etcher. Unfortunately commercial units start at $1k and go much higher than that. Anyone know of any good resources?</p>
