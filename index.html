      <p>Hah, that&#8217;s pretty clever, especially with the pump- I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s a gopro box top. Honestly though, I could just look at that ecig and tell you you&#8217;re not getting 500 charges out of that, the heating coil is pretty high draw and I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s just a 10440 battery in there. That&#8217;s what, 350mah tops with some really good lipos? Heck, even this calculator says the max (assuming ~2 ohm resistance) is about 130 puffs. </p>

      <p>Oooo&#8230;considering how much the Chinese makers of these things outright steal other people&#8217;s designs (or the reference design, hehe) I&#8217;m hoping this means the same thing can be done to a lot of other cheap picture frames. I have two that I got for $15 each and have an 800&#215;600 screen!</p>

      <p>I apologize, as I haven&#8217;t really been in the homebrew gameboy loop since the the gameboy color.  How is this any different from just using a cart player that reads off an sd card which can then be plugged into the computer for dragging and dropping of files?  Is there something more grand here that I&#8217;m missing?</p>
