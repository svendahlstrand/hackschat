      <p>I&#8217;ll have to remember that trick about the ball bearing! I had a job where I did some torch welding, but the tip was too large so I just peened the circumference of the nozzle to reduce the diameter, but the resulting hole wasn&#8217;t nearly as clean as that now did it work as well.</p>

      <p>I think &#8220;overkill&#8221; in this case is a misnomer.  Sure, a phone has a ton of processing power, but how often is it completely wasted?  Once it&#8217;s not the Phone Du Jour, it&#8217;s likely sitting in a drawer.  I think more hacks that keeps these engineering marvels of last year (week?) out of the garbage are warrented.</p>
