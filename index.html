      <p>Yes, after spending weeks with Arduino IDE and PlatformIO trying to compile code for ESP32 in reasonable time and pouring over Espressif docs and Youtube videos for rather simple operations, I&#8217;m beginning to think that I just go back to FPGA development for anything remotely time-critical. Microcontrollers are becoming stupid complex to develop for, and Quartus (almost laughably) is an order of magnitude easier to use. Get a book by Pong P. Chu closest to your FPGA platform/language and you are good to go. The future should be in not relying on the bloated nature of today&#8217;s &#8216;micro&#8217;-controllers, but building your own from the ground up. You&#8217;ll spend the same time either way.</p>

      <p>Speaking as someone who has make a few ten day long trips in space amd weight constrained modes (backpacking, motorcycle camping, and canoeing) I can tell you that the device&#8217;s weight and packed size are going to be much bigger concerns to its end users than either efficiency or absolute power output and presumably the designer was working within these constraints&#8230;</p>

      <p>About 10 years too late. While the 2 resistor hack on a microcontroller is interesting because of the low parts count, this isn&#8217;t going to be that cheap. Small LCD screens are available at not much more than the cost of a composite one, and for going into a TV or similar, the problem is that the RCA inputs are disappearing from TVs. My last one came with an adapter lead to get composite and component video into it, which I have now gone and misplaced.</p>

      <p>Umm, where exactly is the new material here?  Thiago&#8217;s fusor was all over the news (I think it was even on had) last year, and I know that Richard&#8217;s fusor-iii was on here from a long time ago (he built it in the 90s).  The only new project is his fusor-iv is still in the parts gathering phase&#8230;</p>
