      <p>I Like this, I was doing similar but would it be better to make it a universal opto-coupler board, eg pads for IRDA chip, quad optical encoders, PIR and such? and a mini one for IR remotes that&#8217;s on a cable so you can mount LEDS/ Quad encoders where you need them.</p>

      <p>that is exceedingly awesome. It amazes me that something that costs several thousand dollars, a high end computer, and who knows what else for a segway can be done with some plywood and some comodity parts. i&#8217;d like to see a balancing kids toy come out so we could use it&#8217;s brain as a base for a whole slew of homebrew segways.</p>
