      <p>UV cure soldermask ink/paint is readily available on eBay etc in both syringes and larger pots (a little goes a very long way).  Spread it on THIN, cover will cellophane (the specific type of plastic is important, some will bond with it, which is bad, I like cellophane plastic bags, work well) without any air bubbles (air inhibits curing), apply artwork (pads = black), and expose to UV for a few minutes.  Wipe clean the unexposed pads, and give it a few more minutes of UV to fully cure.</p>

      <p>roy, you must have nothing to call a life to feel the need to say that. I&#8217;ve scored first post countless times but never once had an urge to just say &#8220;first&#8221;..I guess because doing so makes you look stupid, not witty or intelligent or anything else positive for that matter.</p>

      <p>I use to run a commercial t-shirt printer when i lived in Oxford, Ms at a print shop. It was about 10k to buy and didn&#8217;t work half the time. It kept clogging up and i would waste alot of t-shirts and ink in the process. It was cool though when it did work. Only the t-shirts faded over time worse than screen printed ones did.</p>
