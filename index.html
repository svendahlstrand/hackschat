      <p>I have an ESP32 checking hall sensors on the chain ring and sending the output to a digital potentionmeter connected in place of Logitech wheel pedals, so pedaling (back and forth) is seen by all racing games as normal wheel input. It works nice! ESP32, because it also outputs the data over BLE to my phone for Strava and Google Fit.</p>

      <p>My favourite piece of software these days is Solvespace. I tried OpenSCAD and made a few parametric models but it takes way too much effort to model simple objects with this language. Solvespace with the constraint engine is a few steps ahead, we just need a friendly interface to let the user of the models enter numerical values for the parameters.</p>

      <p>Actually, my (film) N65 also leaves out the split-circle focus ring in favour of showing the AF sensor zones. I might try this hack, except that I couldn&#8217;t afford to replace my Nikon if I screwed it up.</p>
