      <p>It would be better to have two kites so that the direction and force of the cable travel was a product of the relationship between the two connected kites. Like this fire bow, but with the string geometry folded so both ends are down wind of the turning part, and obviously it would not go back and forth as fast. </p>

      <p>In my (limited) experience with turning drawers upside down for having more working space when i was a kid. be sure the drawers/table is of a certain sturdines/quality, because otherwise you will have a really wobbly/unstable worksurface (at least if drawing directly on it while its just pulled out) and there can also be issues with edges (the drawers bottom not being flush with the side/end-boards of the drawer). Another issue is the angle changing as you pull the drawer out, leaning lower and and lower with the frontend.</p>
