      <p>I think you mean the address inputs not the data inputs being tied to the board inputs. The data bus is tied to the segments of the display, and the address bus would be tied to the board inputs and the patterns for the segments is stored in the flash at the addresses corresponding to the inputs of the board. Essentially a flash look-up table.</p>

      <p>Some crypto features would be nice.  For example, the ability to transfer files from an SD card via IR securely, or to act as a secure authentication token (like SecurID).  A badge that could act as a programmable smartcard would have some definite hack possibility.  Perhaps programmable RFID as well.  Is it simple to make an RFID clone device?  Add the ability to emulate an old-fashioned magstripe card and you would truly have a useful device!</p>
