      <p>Oh god no.  They&#8217;re fun to watch, but I hope to never own one again.  Having lived in an era where pen plotters were a necessity for business, I&#8217;m so glad to see them dead.  Long live laser and inkjet.</p>

      <p>A lot of this type of national instruments all-in-one stuff is actually intended for k-12 education, and is supposed to be &#8216;accessible&#8217; since labview is a click-and-point &#8216;language&#8217;. My middle school had a bit of national instruments gear and labview that we used in our science periods.  </p>
