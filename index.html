      <p>Basically, there is a way to output non-interlaced video on traditional CRT? Wow, I have no idea! How is the 240p decided then? I think I have seen different game consoles of the same generation having different number of vertical resolutions.</p>

      <p>I like the idea of having a functional clone of the Apple I, but I&#8217;d much prefer having a trace-for-trace replica instead. After all, for me at least, the whole idea behind having an Apple I is to have it for Steve Job&#8217;s design skills. It&#8217;s Art. IMO it&#8217;s like having a paint by numbers copy of the Mona Lisa instead of a high quality print.</p>
