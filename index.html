      <p>I I love this. Not just because it reminds me of the Model 1, Level 1 that was my first computer, but also because it runs CP/M. S100 CP/M systems were out of my budget back in the day so I (and many others) flocked to 300-baud public RCP/M systems.  Acoustic couplers FTW! :-)</p>

      <p>You can get a functional, assembled RFID reader from Parallax for $40.  You would need a uC capable of generating the 125 KHz while simultaneously monitoring the power going into the LC antenna circuit and decoding any changes that would indicate the presence of a second tuned or detuned circuit drawing power off it.  It&#8217;s quite a bit more complicated than emulating the card, which was designed to be simple and dirt cheap and not really worth the effort when a turnkey solution is available.</p>

      <p>When splicing cables together, it is usually better to stagger the cuts so that the splices are not all at the same spot on the cable (which creates a bulge). Staggering requires a little more length, but the results are nicer.</p>
