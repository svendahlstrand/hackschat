      <p>Finally they get put to good use! Those LED bus signs are terrible for busses. They don&#8217;t have enough space to show the route number, stop requested, and the next stop at the same time, so if you aren&#8217;t good with directions they don&#8217;t help much at all, you have to wait a long time for the info you want.</p>
