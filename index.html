      <p>Specific impulse is just one of many parameters in a rocket design.  If you wanted maximum Isp, you could use a ground based laser, solar sail or magnetic tether propulsion.  But none of those will get you off the planet.  I think theoerotically a flashlight has a specific impulse of the speed of light, but it&#8217;s not useful because the thrust is insignificant (and I think the battery mass ruins it too?).</p>
